Executive Summary
The AI and energy nexus continues to evolve rapidly
The largest technology companies are contributing to a surge in data centre investment, as
their capital expenditure exceeded USD 400 billion in 2025 – and is expected to jump by
another 75% in 2026. Capital expenditure of just five technology companies is now larger
than global investment in oil and natural gas production. Many jurisdictions are seeing
project pipelines accelerate dramatically, although not all projects will come to fruition.
Those that are moving forward are doing so at pace: the IEA’s unique satellite-based tracking
shows that “artificial intelligence (AI) factories” – cutting-edge data centres specifically
designed for AI – have more than tripled in capacity in the past 18 months. Meanwhile, the
capabilities of AI are improving quickly, increasing the likelihood that it will reshape economic
growth, innovation and competitiveness and disrupt established industries and jobs.
In April 2025, the IEA published its landmark Energy and AI report, which provided first-of-
its-kind global analysis on the links between AI and energy. Since then, the field has evolved
rapidly: new questions have emerged and new data has come to light. This report builds on
the foundation of previous work, providing fresh analysis on key issues. It covers the outlook
for data centre electricity demand considering recent market developments; innovations in
powering data centres; and the implications of these trends for energy security, affordability,
competitiveness and overall energy demand.
Energy consumption per AI query has declined massively, but much more
energy-intensive use cases are becoming increasingly popular
Measured per individual task, the energy efficiency of AI is improving at a rate
unprecedented in energy history. Software and hardware advances have resulted in the
energy use per AI task dropping by at least an order of magnitude annually in recent years.
Simple text queries now typically consume less electricity than running a television over the
same period of time. If all conventional internet searches were performed with simple AI text
queries, it would consume less than 4 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity annually,
equivalent to less than 1% of total data centre consumption today.
However, new energy-intensive AI applications are increasingly being launched and used,
such as those for video generation, reasoning and agentic tasks. These kinds of tasks can
consume hundreds or thousands of times more energy per query than simple text
generation. The energy demand of AI is therefore the result of three rapidly evolving and
uncertain trends: improvements in efficiency, surging uptake, and changing model
capabilities, which can unlock new and, in many instances, far more energy-intensive use
cases. To improve the robustness of the outlook for AI’s energy demand, close monitoring,
frequent updates and cooperation with the tech sector, including more systematic energy
consumption disclosures, will remain important.
The global electricity demand of data centres – the critical infrastructure for training and
running AI models – grew by 17% in 2025, in line with IEA projections. Electricity
consumption from AI-focused data centres grew even faster, surging 50% in 2025. While
there are no comprehensive statistics on the frequency and depth of AI usage around the

world, major model providers reported a threefold increase in active users and a fivefold
increase in revenue over the past year, highlighting the rapid growth of demand.
Across the AI value chain, a scramble for electricity, grid connections,
manufacturing capacity, chips and capital has set in
The speed of the AI revolution is increasingly contrasting with the speed of the physical,
social and economic systems that underpin it. Bottlenecks across energy supply chains and
advanced chip manufacturing have tightened since our last report. Planning and regulatory
systems are being stretched by the wave of project applications for data centres, amid a
broader trend of rapid load growth and electrification. Social acceptability is also a growing
issue, as communities push back against data centre projects, and concerns about
affordability and environmental impacts rise. Essential elements within the IT industry are
currently facing limitations; notably, a shortage of high-bandwidth memory – integral to AI
chip production – has developed over the past six months and is anticipated to persist
through at least the end of 2027.
Data centre investments have grown too large to be funded from company balance sheets
alone, and large amounts of funding from capital markets will be critical for their buildout.
As a result, the pace of data centre growth, and the resulting increase in energy consumption,
will be sensitive to market sentiment, including expectations for returns on investment in
data centres and AI deployment, as well as to broader macroeconomic and financing
conditions. Understanding the energy implications of AI therefore also means following
closely the technology’s economic trajectory.
Our updated data centre electricity demand outlook sees near-term
bottlenecks but longer-term upside
The central projection for electricity demand from data centres remains close to the
trajectory set out in the IEA’s 2025 report. Our updated projections see electricity
consumption from data centres roughly doubling from 485 TWh in 2025 to 950 TWh in 2030,
accounting for around 3% of global electricity demand by that date. Electricity consumption
from AI-focused data centres grows much faster than overall data centre electricity
consumption, tripling in this period. Bottlenecks across the value chain, however, are
reducing the likelihood of more aggressive near-term scenarios, despite booming investment
and surging project pipelines.
The mid- to longer-term outlook for data centre electricity demand sees a possible upside.
Investments in relieving bottlenecks across energy equipment and chip manufacturing, and
rapid uptake of energy-intensive use cases of AI, raise the prospect that there could be an
even higher upside case after 2030. The IEA will continue to update its projections regularly.
AI is pushing data centre power density to the limits of today’s technologies
An individual server rack within an advanced data centre is only the size of a large
refrigerator, but by 2027 it could have peak power demand equivalent to that of
65 households. The speed of this shift is remarkable: between 2020 and 2025, the power

density of AI servers increased by 11 times; by 2027, it is set to see a further fourfold increase.
This will test the capacity to ramp up supply chains for key electricity technologies such as
power electronics and transformers. Some of these technologies also depend on critical
inputs from a small number of producers, notably China. Care is therefore needed to ensure
that supply chains for the critical emerging technologies going into data centres are diverse
and resilient.
Still an energy taker, the tech sector is also increasingly an energy maker
The tech sector remains a major driver of renewables procurement, accounting for around
40% of all corporate renewables power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed globally in
2025. Renewables PPAs signed by data centre companies are equivalent to almost half the
sector’s current consumption. But procurement innovation extends beyond renewables. The
tech sector has become a major driver of momentum behind both conventional and new
nuclear plants, as well as next-generation geothermal. Since the IEA’s 2025 report, the
pipeline of data centre offtake agreements with small modular reactors (SMRs) has grown
from around 25 GW at the end of 2024 to 45 GW by the end of 2025. Nonetheless, the first
projects are not expected to come online until around 2030.
Unlike traditional data centre operations, AI training and model use induce large and rapid
power swings, making energy storage critical to ensure that electricity is always supplied
reliably. By 2030, around 20-25 GW of battery storage could be installed in data centres
globally, potentially making them a grid asset if the incentives are right. Recent months have
seen a data centre operator sign an agreement for the largest battery project ever by energy
capacity (four times larger than the previous record-holder), helping to commercialise long-
duration energy storage.
Constrained by slow grid connections, data centre developers in the United States are
pushing forward projects with onsite natural gas-based power generation. Satellite tracking
of these projects indicates that around one-fifth have started land clearing or construction.
This highlights that onsite gas power is an emerging solution, with key design, supply chain,
regulatory and financial questions remaining. New IEA analysis shows that providing reliable
onsite gas-fired electricity to meet critical and variable data centre load requires overbuilding
onsite generation infrastructure by 30% to 70% relative to demand. Yet in the context of a
supply crunch for gas turbines, it is not clear that onsite generation necessarily promises a
faster route to market for data centres at scale. Though uncertainties are high, around
15-27 GW of onsite natural gas may power data centres by 2030, mostly in the United States.
However, this does not remove the urgency of addressing grid bottlenecks, as most data
centres prefer connecting to the grid.
The AI boom could therefore accelerate deployment and innovation in the electricity
sector, if spending continues and if government support is also aligned. In this report, we
analysed share price movements of AI and energy companies to understand how financial
markets expect AI’s energy demand to impact energy companies. On the one hand, financial
valuations since the launch of ChatGPT do not suggest that AI demand will provide a
generalised uplift to the energy sector; it is simply too small in the context of the energy

sector as a whole. In contrast, manufacturers of gas turbines and electrical equipment, some
nuclear companies, and some energy startups have seen their valuations become more
strongly linked to AI, highlighting the pull that data centre demand is providing for innovation
and growth in their businesses.
Even if AI boosts economic growth, the impact on energy demand will be
lower
Initial signs indicate AI is boosting productivity in some sectors, which may push up overall
economic growth. There are a wide range of projections of the impact of AI on GDP. Based
on cooperation with the OECD and economic modelling of the possible task-by-task
productivity boost coming from AI, this report provides a first-of-its-kind analysis of the
implications of an AI-driven GDP boost on the energy sector.
Stronger economic growth from AI does not translate one-to-one into higher energy
demand. It is concentrated in knowledge-intensive services and high-income countries,
where the elasticity between energy demand and economic activity is lower. Estimates show
that, depending on the scale of uptake, an AI-driven growth boost could raise the level of
global energy demand by between 1-4% in 2035 compared with trends without this AI boost.
Effects are concentrated in advanced economies, particularly the United States, although
emerging and developing economies also benefit from increased economic activity.
Ultimately, what matters most for energy demand are energy policies and energy
technologies. In our analysis, the impact of energy policies and energy technology
developments on energy demand is much larger than the potential impact of an AI-driven
economic growth boost.
In an unstable world, the links between AI and energy security have
tightened
Over the past year, energy and technology supply chains have become further strained.
Trade restrictions have targeted key components going into data centres, such as the critical
minerals needed for advanced power electronics, or the batteries and battery components
needed to smooth AI loads. A 70% surge in gas turbine orders in 2025 has highlighted
chokepoints in energy technology supply chains. And data centres themselves have been
targeted in conflict zones, underscoring their role as critical infrastructure. The broader
implications of the energy crisis tied to the conflict in the Middle East are still unknown, but
they could extend to the choices that countries and companies make about the fuels and
technologies used to power data centres, and where sites are located.
AI has the potential to be an important tool to enhance energy security and sustainability.
For example, AI technologies monitor grids, transformers and other energy equipment to
reduce unexpected failures and outages, and AI and digital grid-enhancing technologies are
key to optimising the use of existing grid capacity, helping to offset lengthy and costly grid
expansions. At the same time, AI risks making cyberattacks easier and more powerful, and
an increasingly digitalised energy sector presents new vulnerabilities.

Executive Summary
13

With increasing deployment of AI-enabled robotics, automation and efficiency solutions,
AI will be critical to industrial competitiveness. Advances in data, models and hardware now
allow for broader automation in industrial design and production, speeding up development,
boosting innovation and lowering costs. The AI-enabled optimisation of production
processes could reduce energy costs by 3-10 percentage points in energy-intensive
industries, where energy is a critical production input and margins tend to be low. Well-
documented AI use cases have the potential to save over 13 exajoules (EJ) of energy by 2035,
equivalent to 3% of global final energy consumption, if barriers to wider uptake are
overcome. Longer-term, AI could unlock another wave of industrial innovation and
productivity: the almost two-fold jump in venture capital going into this field in 2025 is a
marker of the potential. The race to develop more powerful AI models is being run alongside
another race to apply AI across the economy for innovation and productivity, with China
particularly focused on the latter.
But the energy sector is not yet taking full advantage of AI opportunities
An IEA survey of energy companies reveals that the lack of digital skills is the single largest
barrier to greater AI adoption in the energy sector. The adoption of AI is also limited by
fragmented data and concerns related to data protection, privacy, and cybersecurity. For
example, only 10% of global electricity consumption is covered by open electricity data
policies. The lack of adequate digitalisation of equipment can also be a barrier. Globally, less
than half of energy demand is covered by policy frameworks aiming to promote the uptake
of AI in the energy sector.
Social concerns around AI have grown, focusing particularly on the
environment and electricity prices…
Data centres are a highly visible flashpoint for concerns around energy prices and the
environment. Energy prices have risen up the agenda since the inflationary shock of Covid-
19 and the 2022 global energy crisis, with the energy crisis sparked by the conflict in the
Middle East compounding concerns. In addition to the potential impact of data centres on
electricity prices, surveys increasingly show that citizens are concerned about AI’s effect on
jobs, the economy, the environment, and society more broadly. The emissions associated
with data centres double in IEA projections, reaching around 350 million tonnes in 2035, but
still make up about 2% of global electricity sector emissions by that date.
…but with the right conditions, data centres do not necessarily raise
electricity prices
The impact of electricity demand growth on electricity prices depends on a combination of
fundamental factors and policy choices. In systems with tighter demand-supply balances,
load growth can indeed trigger a need for new investments, potentially raising prices. On the
other hand, in systems with excess electricity supply, load growth can result in more efficient
capital utilisation and lower prices. The shape of the load growth matters too. In the same
way that high and reliable passenger numbers can allow airlines to lower average ticket
prices on established routes, predictable baseload electricity demand can increase the

efficiency of the use of capital-intensive power plants and grids, potentially lowering
electricity prices.
Data centres can create special challenges for electricity affordability. Data centres are
large, concentrated, rapidly developed infrastructure that are likely to trigger a need for new
generation and grid investments in systems that host them. Actual peak load from data
centres is often uncertain, as data centres are filled progressively with operating servers and
often oversize their grid connections initially. The mismatch between fast-moving data
centres and slow-moving energy investments, and the uncertainty over their load, creates
risks of misalignment between electricity system investment and data centre demand that
could raise electricity prices in some places if unmitigated.
Policy remains key to ensuring AI and data centres play a constructive role in
energy systems
The IEA proposes three principles to help ensure AI deployment is leveraged for the benefit
of the energy sector, and that data centres minimise any adverse impacts on electricity
systems.

Proactive management of data centre project pipelines and electricity sector
investment can support adequate and reliable electricity for the sector without
adversely affecting prices. This includes reforming the management of data centre
connection queues and streamlining permitting timelines. Similarly, more robust
demand projections, building on greater disclosure from technology companies and
strong cooperation with system operators, can help ensure investments are well
aligned. Finally, how costs are allocated in the electricity system is ultimately up to
policymakers. Tools such as tariff schemes can support the fair allocation of the costs of
grid upgrades and new generation capacity.

Approaches that promote electricity system flexibility can help accelerate grid
connections and ensure electricity affordability. This can help defer the need for large
investments and improve the efficiency of expensive grid and generation investments.
System operators can explore non-firm grid connections and incentivise data centre
developers to provide demand response in return for faster connection processes.
Increasingly sophisticated, grid-interactive onsite power assets, such as battery storage
and gas-fired generators, can help data centres support grid operations, moving data
centres from grid loads to grid resources.

Removing barriers to AI adoption in the energy sector can ensure AI is leveraged to
enhance energy security and sustainability. Comprehensive policy frameworks that
address data availability, cybersecurity, skills, and interoperability are crucial for
boosting AI uptake. As public concerns grow around the local impacts of data centres,
and the broader implications of AI on jobs and fairness, social acceptability will hinge on
demonstrating AI’s benefits for affordable, secure and sustainable energy systems,
including at the local level.

Key questions on energy and AI
AI at the intersection of energy security,
innovation and competitiveness
Introduction
The IEA published its first special report on energy and artificial intelligence (AI) in April 2025
(IEA, 2025a). The report explored three questions. Firstly, how much energy does artificial
intelligence, and the data centres that underpin the technology, need? Secondly, how can
the energy sector meet growing demand from AI and data centres? And finally, to what
extent can AI help optimise the energy sector and accelerate energy innovation? The report
provided the first global and system-wide analysis of these questions, building on the IEA’s
unique models and data. The report helped contextualise the role of AI in the broader energy
system – and continues to remain relevant at the time of publication of this new report.
AI, however, is a fast-moving field. There have been several key developments since the
publication of the first special report. AI models have continued to improve and new use
cases, such as multi-step tasks (agentic AI), have become commonplace. As AI advances, so
does its potential to transform the economy, raising questions around whether an AI-driven
growth boost could trigger a surge in energy demand beyond AI’s direct energy use.
Energy supply chain and permitting bottlenecks have intensified, while rapidly changing data
centre designs are altering the power needs of data centres. In response, data centre
developers are searching for innovative power solutions, including onsite gas generation,
batteries, and demand response. Outside the energy sector, constraints in supply chains for
manufacturing the cutting-edge chips and servers going into data centres also need to be
factored into the outlook, and these supply chains are shifting rapidly in response to
developments within AI.
At the same time, there are growing concerns over the impact of data centres on the
environment and electricity prices. This has led to increased public scrutiny, and to policy
responses to address these issues. In parallel, new datasets have been released over the past
year, which throw further light on the intersection of energy and AI. For example, AI
companies have disclosed more information about the per-task energy consumption of AI
and the efficiency improvements being achieved in AI software and hardware.
These fast-moving developments necessitate new analysis to advance and deepen the
understanding of AI’s links with the energy sector and support evolving policy responses. This
new report builds on our 2025 publication and is structured in three sections:

Factors influencing electricity demand by data centres

Powering data centres

Impact of AI on energy

International Energy Agency | Key questions on energy and AI

In each of these sections, the material is organised around key questions, which pinpoint
new and important developments since our last report. Given that this report builds on our
2025 publication, the remainder of this introduction provides a high-level summary of the
key findings of our 2025 analysis.
Key findings from the IEA’s Energy and AI special report of 2025
Our 2025 report provided comprehensive estimates of data centre electricity consumption
historically and projections to 2030 and 2035. These projections were structured into four
sensitivities, or cases. Our Base Case saw electricity consumption of data centres more than
double by 2030, while in our highest case, Lift-Off, it tripled in the same timeframe. The wide
range of outcomes was due to uncertainties on the uptake and economics of AI; the outlook
for efficiency improvements of models and chips; and in how quickly energy sector
bottlenecks can be resolved.
Our 2025 report projected that data centres will be powered by a range of sources, led by
renewables and natural gas. Most data centre developers have specific sustainability goals
and are major procurers of renewables. At the same time, the scale of data centre load
growth, taking place in a broader context of rising electrification, means that utilities are
seeking to procure additional, dispatchable capacities to meet overall load growth reliably.
In several markets, particularly the United States and Middle East, much of this is set to come
from natural gas. At the same time, the challenge of grid integration of data centres is also
creating incentives for innovative solutions, which our 2025 report analysed. These include
incentivising data centres to provide various forms of demand flexibility to facilitate
smoother integration into electricity grids.
Our 2025 report also analysed the applications of AI across the energy system. It documented
numerous use cases of AI in optimising energy sector processes, from managing power
systems, to optimising industrial processes, to supporting the exploration and production of
oil and gas. In addition, the report analysed the potential for AI to accelerate energy
technology innovation. Overall, our analysis found that while AI has substantial potential to
improve the operation of energy systems, and accelerate the discovery of new technologies,
it is not a “silver bullet” for challenges like environmental sustainability or affordability.
Finally, our report analysed emerging cross cutting issues, such as the total investments
needed in data centres and related energy infrastructure, the supply chain risks arising from
the build-out of data centres for components such as critical minerals or transformers, and
the specific challenges faced by emerging market and developing economies.
This analysis forms the basis of the present report, which aims to provide a timely update of
a field that is moving at an unprecedented pace compared to the typical speed of
developments in the energy sector.

Factors influencing electricity
demand by data centres

In light of recent market trends, has the IEA adjusted its
data centre demand outlook?
Electricity consumption by data centres grew by more than 15% between 2024 and 2025,
adding around 70 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity demand and taking the sector’s annual
consumption to almost 500 TWh, or slightly more than 1.5% of global electricity demand.
The combined electricity consumption of four major hyperscalers grew by 20% in 2024, the
most recent full year for which data are available, reaching 110 TWh. Data on the planned
global project pipeline for data centres as of the beginning of 2026 imply that, if all projects
are realised, installed capacity from the sector would at least double in the coming years
(Figure 1.1).

International Energy Agency | Key questions on energy and AI

The IEA produced comprehensive global and regional projections of data centre electricity
consumption in its 2025 report, Energy and AI (IEA, 2025a). The report highlighted several of
the challenges involved in projecting data centre electricity consumption. Data on the sector
remain patchy, which necessitates careful analysis of a range of sources to ensure
robustness. The uptake of artificial intelligence (AI) is proceeding very rapidly, but
technological, financial and commercial uncertainties remain. Moreover, the sector is
integrated into complex value chains, ranging from chips to transformers, electrical
switchgear, turbines and local electricity markets, and constraints in these value chains play
out in complex ways. Against this backdrop, this section sets out some key considerations
shaping the evolving outlook.
1.1
Big numbers, complex signals: Interpreting the message from financial
markets
AI today is highly capital intensive. Cutting-edge data centres for AI can have capital costs,
including information technology (IT) equipment, of USD 40 000 to 50 000 per kilowatt (kW)
(five to ten times more than a nuclear power plant on a per-kW basis). The IEA’s estimates
for data centre growth imply cumulative investment in data centres of USD 3.9 trillion
between 2026 and 2030. This is too large to be funded solely from the balance sheets of AI
companies and will require capital from debt and equity markets. As a result, financial market
perceptions of the return on investment in data centres and AI will be a material factor
shaping the sector’s development.
In the second half of 2025, the sentiment among investors in financial markets shifted from
generalised optimism regarding AI towards a more cautious stance in light of the huge
investments required and uncertain prospects for monetisation. Hyperscalers saw their
market capitalisation increase by around USD 2 trillion from March 2025 to October 2025,
while the value of leading chip designers increased by USD 2.5 trillion (Figure 1.2). New
entrants into the data centre sector, so-called “neo-clouds”, saw a 110% increase in market
capitalisation across the same period, representing an aggregate gain of USD 0.5 trillion. Chip
manufacturers increased their market capitalisation by around USD 0.7 trillion.
Since then, growth in market capitalisation has ground to a halt across the AI value chain.
Neo-clouds have given up almost all of their gains since March 2025, while the market
capitalisation of established hyperscalers and chip designers has stagnated. While there are
pockets of growth, the shift is quite broad-based. One exception is chip manufacturers, which
have continued to see strong share price growth, notably due to the shortage of memory
chip manufacturing capacity.
A major driver of this shift in market sentiment has been concern over the huge growth in
capital expenditure for data centres. Leading hyperscalers and neo-clouds have announced
a 75% increase in capital expenditure for 2026, amounting to USD 715 billion. This is
substantially more than annual investment in the entire energy sector of the United States,
which totalled slightly less than USD 600 billion in 2024. In recent years, hyperscaler

investments have largely been funded through cash from operations. However, the upswing
in capital expenditure has been so significant that it will absorb almost all cash generation in
2026, leading companies to turn increasingly to debt markets (Figure 1.2). In 2025, normally
cash-rich AI companies issued around USD 200 billion in debt, and they are set to become
among the largest issuers of corporate debt going forward (Bloomberg, 2025).
Figure 1.2 ⊳

Markets are sending mixed signals: hyperscaler capital expenditure, largely on data
centres, has surged, while equity market investors have become more cautious
Notes: Hyperscalers = Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services; chip designers = Nvidia, AMD,
Arm and Broadcom; chip manufacturers = TSMC, Samsung Electronics and SK hynix; neo-clouds = Oracle,
CoreWeave and Nebius; Capex = capital expenditures. The right-hand chart shows hyperscalers and Oracle.
Capital expenditure for 2026 comes from company guidance, except in the case of Microsoft, where it is based
on consensus estimates. Cash from operations for 2026 is based on consensus estimates.

Markets are therefore sending mixed signals about the outlook for data centre growth.
Capital expenditure, largely on data centres, is surging, signalling both optimism about the
demand outlook among AI companies and stiff competition to capture it. At the same time,
equity and debt markets are showing increasing signs of concern that this surge in spending
is running ahead of AI monetisation. The continued growth in the market capitalisation of
chip manufacturers highlights the bottlenecks in scaling cutting-edge manufacturing capacity
and the reality that the AI surge is increasingly coming up against physical constraints (see
Section 1.3).

1.2
Public policy support
Data centres are increasingly viewed by national policy makers as essential infrastructure
that is critical for digital sovereignty, security and economic competitiveness. As a result, a
growing number of governments are putting in place policies to support data centre growth.
The world’s leading data centre markets, the United States and China, both have supportive
policies in place. In the United States, as of late 2025, at least 37 states (NCSL, 2025) had tax
incentive measures targeting data centres, while the federal government has sought to
accelerate the permitting and build-out of data centre infrastructure. In 2025, China
continued to roll out AI infrastructure, registering 42 graphics processing unit (GPU) clusters
with more than 10 000 chips (China Daily, 2026), and a large fibre optic network upgrade was
commissioned to support the development of the “East Data, West Compute” initiative. At
the same time, senior officials in China, including the president, have warned against
overinvestment in data centres, and a large number of data centre projects have been
cancelled in recent months (Data Centre Dynamics, 2025).
Over the past decade, the growth of data centre capacity in the European Union has been
slower than the global average, resulting in a loss of global market share. However, through
its AI Continent Action Plan framework (European Commission, 2025a), the
European Commission has set out the goal of tripling data centre capacity in the next five to
seven years. Recent months have seen a notable acceleration in the development of the
bloc’s project pipeline. Based on IEA analysis, the total capacity implied by the project
pipeline is 2.3 times current installed capacity (IEA, 2025b), although overcoming energy
constraints will be critical to achieving this. Other markets in Europe, such as the
United Kingdom and Norway, have also seen significant growth in their project pipelines.
Other key markets, especially in Asia, have shown strong momentum. India recently adopted
new tax incentives for data centres in its 2026 budget and has seen growth in its project
pipeline. The government’s position to expand data centre capacity in the country was
emphasised during the AI Impact Summit, which it hosted in February 2026. Southeast Asia
has also seen rapid growth in its project pipeline, with more than 6 gigawatts (GW) proposed.
Malaysia is a key driver of this momentum (Baker McKenzie, 2025), with dedicated policy
incentives to maintain an attractive environment for AI-focused data centre operators. In
addition, Singapore has launched a call for applications for 200 megawatts (MW) of
additional capacity (IMDA, 2025), reversing the pause on new projects that had been in place
since 2019. Indonesia also has a significant pipeline of projects, although many are at an early
stage (Ember, 2025).
The rise of “gigafactory” announcements for AI data centre projects was another key trend
in 2025.1 These huge projects, which in many cases exceed the total installed data centre
capacity of the host countries today, make projecting data centre electricity consumption
challenging for some regions. Most of these projects are at a very early stage of development

1 In this context, gigafactory refers to gigawatt-scale data centres.

Factors influencing electricity demand by data centres
21

and, because of their size relative to existing infrastructure, the cancellation or delay of a
single project could fundamentally change the outlook for data centre electricity
consumption. For instance, in the Middle East, the pipeline of gigafactory data centres is an
order of magnitude larger than the region’s entire installed data centre capacity today (Epoch
AI, 2026a). The total project pipeline in the Middle East is almost 10 GW.
1.3
Physical bottlenecks
In the IEA’s 2025 report Energy and AI, we highlighted several physical constraints that may
slow the development of data centres (IEA, 2025a). These included bottlenecks in supply
chains for electrical equipment, grid bottlenecks and constraints across the IT value chain,
such as the following:

Key auxiliary equipment used in data centres is facing critical bottlenecks, with lead
times increasing and prices rising. For instance, lead times for transformers average
between two and three years. For gas turbines, deliveries could take around five years
(Wood Mackenzie, 2025).

Waiting times for grid connections can be as long as five to ten years in many
jurisdictions. Policy makers and regulators are taking action to address this bottleneck,
including through reforms to connection procedures and connection queue
management (see Box 1.2), as well as investments to make grids more efficient, but
progress will take time. Recently, numerous proposals have emerged for data centres
powered by onsite generation, which may help ease this constraint in some instances,
where feasible (see section 6).
Outside the energy sector, the data centre build-out is also facing constraints in the supply
chain of key IT equipment. In 2025, limitations in the packaging capacity for high-end chips
were one such constraining factor.2 In the second half of 2025 and beginning of 2026, global
production capacity for high-end memory also emerged as a binding constraint on the rate
of AI server production. Specialised AI chips, such as GPUs, require enormous amounts of
high-bandwidth memory. In 2023, the market-leading GPU systems included less than
150 gigabytes (GB) of memory. By 2027, this is set to grow by an order of magnitude to more
than 1 000 GB (SemiAnalysis, 2025a). AI is highly memory-intensive and is therefore the key
driver of this trend. Producing high-bandwidth memory requires three times the wafer
capacity of conventional memory to achieve the same GB output (Micron, 2024). The result
of this trend has been a sudden production bottleneck in high-end memory. Prices for
memory increased by an order of magnitude between late 2024 and early 2026, and
inventory declined from almost four months in late 2024 to around three weeks in late 2025
(Figure 1.3). Memory manufacturers are racing to build new factories, but the constraints
will not be addressed overnight. It takes about two years to bring a new chip factory into

operation. As a result, the shortage of AI memory could last at least until late 2027 (IDC,
2025). Analysts estimate that current high-bandwidth memory production can support a
maximum of around 25 GW of AI-ready servers per year through to 2027, broadly in line with
the rate of capacity additions in the IEA’s Base Case. More recently, the current disruptions
to supply chains in the Middle East could impact critical production inputs for data centres,
such as helium (Box 1.1).
In addition to supply chain constraints, concerns about the local impact of data centres,
including their implications for the environment and energy affordability, have led to the
cancellation or delay of data centre projects. In the second quarter of 2025, 20 projects with
estimated investment of USD 98 billion were blocked or delayed in the United States (Data
Center Watch, 2025). Growing local opposition could also affect the provision of policy,
regulatory and fiscal incentives for data centres, such as tax exemptions.
Box 1.1 ⊳     What is the role of helium in AI chip production, and what is the impact
of the 2026 Middle East conflict on its supply?
Helium is a critical enabler of advanced AI chip manufacturing. Helium's exceptional
thermal conductivity allows it to efficiently cool manufacturing equipment, and its
chemical inertness (inability to react with other chemicals) keeps contamination-free
conditions stable. For the manufacturing of high-performance chips used in AI, there is
currently no substitute that can match helium's cooling and cleaning properties. Without
a steady supply, the precision machines owned by companies like TSMC and Intel simply
cannot function.
The ongoing conflict in the Middle East has highlighted the critical role of this gas in AI
chip manufacturing, and the impact of the conflict on chip shipments. Qatar, which
supplied roughly one-third of global helium before the conflict, has seen production at
Ras Laffan and related facilities significantly damaged, with reports of around 14% cuts
to annual helium exports as of March 2026 (AP, 2026) and an effective temporary loss of
supply equivalent to approximately one-third of world production (USGS, 2026). The
strikes forced Qatar’s state producer to declare force majeure, while the partial closure
of the Strait of Hormuz has constrained shipping routes that move a significant share of
global helium volumes, driving spot prices sharply higher. These disruptions
disproportionately affect chip manufacturing hubs of Chinese Taipei and South Korea –
which manufactured a large majority of all advanced semiconductors globally – and
which sourced more than half of their helium from Gulf suppliers in recent years (Gas
World, 2026).
Since the disruption of supply, semiconductor manufacturers have been leaning on
inventories and diversified contracts to continue production. The IEA will continue to
monitor the supply chains of key inputs to the manufacturing of chips to help inform its
analysis on data centre server shipments and therefore electricity demand from them.

Key takeaways
Projecting the electricity consumption of data centres is a complicated exercise that requires
consideration of a range of factors. These include: the economics of and demand for AI itself;
trends in energy efficiency and the development of more energy intensive AI modes; and
how bottlenecks across the energy and IT equipment supply chain play out in the years to
come. These uncertainties mean that a scenario framework is useful to provide different
stakeholders with the tools to assess the implications of different possible trajectories. In our
2025 report, we developed a scenario framework based around four cases:

The Base Case provides the central projection and considers trends in AI development,
investment, and bottlenecks in energy and IT supply chains.

The Lift-Off Case explores the impact of stronger AI adoption and increased global
demand for digital services, leading to even stronger deployment of data centre facilities
than in the Base Case. It assumes that bottlenecks can be effectively resolved over time,
with increases in manufacturing capacity for chips and energy equipment, and policy
progress and innovation easing constraints such as grid connection wait times.


In the Headwinds Case, service demand and AI adoption grows more slowly. AI
monetisation challenges reduce investment, while local constraints and electricity
supply issues delay data centre development. Broader macroeconomic headwinds, such
as higher interest rates or trade restrictions, could also push outcomes in the direction
implied by the Headwinds Case.

In the High Efficiency Case we assume that AI and digital services demand follow the
same trajectory as in the Base Case. However, several efficiency strategies are
implemented to counterbalance the increased energy demand resulting from the higher
adoption of digital technologies, particularly AI. These include rightsizing models,
continued improvements in model efficiency, and possible shifts towards more edge
computing.
Taking recent developments into account, the balance of evidence suggests that the scenario
framework we developed in our 2025 Energy and AI report continues to provide a sound
frame of reference out to 2030. Now updated for this report, our Base Case still sees data
centre electricity consumption growing from around 415 TWh in 2024 to around 950 TWh in
2030 (Figure 1.4). This means that data centre electricity consumption accounts for slightly
less than 10% of total electricity demand growth globally to 2030, although some regions are
much more affected. While some trends, such as booming investment and growing project
pipelines (see Box 1.2) would appear to point to an upward revision in the Base Case, we
believe this case continues to provide a balanced assessment of both the strong momentum
in AI and data centres, and the real financial and physical frictions that limit the rate of near-
term growth.

Given these physical constraints and local concerns, our Lift-Off Case appears closer to our
Base Case in the near-term. Beyond 2030, the outlook becomes more uncertain. On the one
hand, physical constraints that shape the outlook in the near-term will start to relax over
time. On the other hand, the incredibly rapid growth in AI capabilities and demand suggests
that growth in electricity consumption could surprise on the upside over the longer-term
after 2030. Our Headwinds Case and High Efficiency Case remain largely unchanged from our
2025 report, although they start to diverge from our Base Case somewhat later. This is due
to the strong near-term momentum in data centre investment, and clear near-term trends
towards more energy intensive AI modes, such as agentic AI, becoming widely adopted (see
Section 2).
The IEA’s data centre demand model is based on physical shipments of servers going into
data centres, as these are the core electricity consuming equipment within data centres.
Inputs to the IEA’s model come from IT sector projections for the manufacturing and
shipment of these servers historically and over the next five years. Given their high power
intensity, a key variable in these projections is the annual manufacturing and shipment of so-
called accelerators – specialised chips such as graphics processing units (GPUs) and tensor
processing units (TPUs) that perform the parallel computations required for AI model training
and use.

consumption of AI-focused data centres, i.e. those with large numbers of servers equipped
with specialised accelerators designed for training and running AI models. In the Base Case,
the electricity consumption of these AI-focused data centres increases by more than
threefold to 2030, reaching around 465 TWh by 2030 (Figure 1.5).
The key driver of the electricity consumption of AI focused data centres is the shipment of AI
accelerators. In the Base Case, these increase by a factor of 2.2 from 2025 to 2030, in line
with the projections of shipments from the IT sector (OMDIA, 2026). In the Base Case, around
20 GW of accelerated servers are added per year by 2030. This does not include auxiliary
consumption for functions like cooling, nor the addition of conventional server capacities.
Box 1.1 ⊳
Understanding the boom in connection queues
Data centre connection queues have increased dramatically in many jurisdictions.
However, while the speed and size of this increase are unique to data centres, large
connection queues are not. They are often also large and convoluted for other types of
projects. For both generation and demand projects, the system operator undertakes
detailed connection studies to ensure that a project can be absorbed securely by the grid
and to determine what grid upgrades may be required. Long connection queues
therefore put pressure on the same regulatory system, regardless of whether the
requests come from demand or generation projects.

connection queue for large loads, around three-quarters of which were data centres, was
around 63 GW. Just four months later, it had more than doubled to 130 GW. By January
2026, it had nearly doubled again to over 230 GW. For comparison, the state’s all-time
high for peak demand is 85 GW. The generation connection queue has also increased,
albeit much more slowly, and is dominated by non-dispatchable resources (225 GW of
wind and solar). Batteries are the single largest technology in the connection queue, and
natural gas projects in the queue have doubled since April 2025 to 57 GW (Figure 1.6).
Many jurisdictions are undertaking reforms to rationalise connection queues. These
often involve stricter readiness tests, including larger upfront financial requirements and
tighter project timelines. They may also involve “first ready, first connected” approaches
or offers of non-firm grid connections. Others are experimenting with prioritisation
frameworks, giving faster treatment to projects that support system needs, for example
those that avoid siting near congested nodes. Several jurisdictions are also
tightening timelines and accountability, with clearer deadlines for feasibility studies,
greater data transparency on available capacity and, in some cases, performance
incentives or penalties for both developers and system operators to keep queues moving.
These approaches are critical to enabling better planning for real load growth. The surge
in project applications for data centres also highlights why project pipelines alone are not
a reliable indicator of future demand, as only a limited and uncertain share of the pipeline
may ultimately be realised. This creates challenges for system operators.

International Energy Agency | Key questions on energy and AI

To what extent can efficiency improvements moderate
AI electricity growth?
Rapid growth in data centres and AI is driving rising electricity demand in some regions. A
central question is whether, and to what extent, efficiency improvements can moderate this
trend. Gains are being delivered through two main channels. Software-level advances have
so far yielded some of the largest and fastest reductions in energy per unit of compute, often
without requiring new capital investment. Hardware and infrastructure improvements are
equally essential over the medium to long term, though they typically materialise more
slowly due to capital cycles and physical constraints.
Yet efficiency is only one side of the equation. Several concurrent trends in AI development
are raising the compute intensity of individual tasks: advanced reasoning models generate
longer chains of inference; multimodal systems integrating text, images and video demand
greater compute and memory bandwidth; and agentic AI systems that plan and execute
multi-step tasks autonomously can consume orders of magnitude more tokens per
interaction than a simple query. By lowering costs and making AI tools more capable and
accessible, efficiency gains are also fuelling broader adoption of AI services, a dynamic known
as the Jevons paradox. As a result, even with continued rapid improvement in energy
efficiency, total electricity consumption from AI is set to increase in the near term.
2.1
Software improvements
Software-level improvements have so far delivered some of the largest reductions in energy
use per AI task, often without requiring new capital investment. Advances in model and
algorithm efficiency have significantly reduced compute requirements while delivering
comparable performance. Research estimates that the compute needed to reach a given
level of language model performance has halved roughly every eight months (Ho et al.,
2024). In production environments, combined improvements across models, software and
serving infrastructure have delivered even larger gains (Elsworth et al., 2025). Smaller, more
specialised models increasingly match or surpass the performance of older, large general-
purpose systems while using far less energy, particularly for narrowly defined tasks (Stanford,
2025).
Further gains come from inference3 optimisation and deployment choices. Techniques such
as batching, caching, speculative decoding, quantised inference (running a trained model
using lower‑precision numeric representations than those the model was originally trained
with) and hardware-aware compilation can substantially lower energy use per query.
Industry reporting indicates that the cost per token of inference has fallen by orders of

system optimisation, and newer and more specialised hardware. Improvements in workload

reduce total data centre electricity consumption per workload, though reported savings
depend heavily on the starting baseline and server types.
Energy use also varies significantly by task type. Short text queries can consume fractions of
a watt-hour on modern systems, whereas generating high-resolution images may require ten
times more energy per request. Video generation can require hundreds to thousands of
times more energy, depending on duration and resolution. More complex reasoning models
that produce longer outputs or use iterative problem-solving also consume materially more
energy per query than brief text completions. Context-rich queries, where users supply
documents, images or large datasets alongside a prompt, further increase per-request
energy use.

per interaction than a simple text completion query, significantly increasing absolute
inference energy demand (Figure 2.1). Unlike conventional chat-based interactions, agentic
AI applications can also decouple compute demand from direct human attention, meaning
that systems may run continuously without a user actively waiting for a response.
Task-aware deployment – selecting appropriately sized models and limiting high-intensity
generation to cases where it adds clear value – can therefore substantially reduce
operational energy demand. In practice, however, competitive pressures and user
expectations tend to favour overprovisioning of model capability, creating a persistent gap
between what is technically efficient and functionally sufficient and what is actually
deployed.
2.2
Hardware improvements
Hardware improvements remain essential for scaling AI systems and data centres over the
medium to long term. Over the past decade, leading AI processors and accelerators have
improved performance per watt by roughly 30-40% per year on average (Figure 2.2),
although gains have been uneven and are gradually slowing as transistor scaling matures.
Successive generations of GPUs and AI-specific chips have delivered large jumps in energy
efficiency through architectural innovation, advanced process nodes and high-bandwidth
memory integration. In addition, task-specific accelerators, such as tensor processing units
and inference-optimised application-specific integrated circuits, significantly outperform
general-purpose central processing units in machine learning workloads, and for certain
targeted workloads, they can achieve higher performance per watt than contemporary AI
GPUs. This can reduce energy use per operation by several multiples in many cases.
As core compute becomes more efficient, system-level factors increasingly determine total
energy consumption. Memory access, data movement and interconnects now account for a
growing share of AI system energy use, particularly in large, distributed training clusters. By
improving how a model’s work is divided across processors, streamlining data exchange and
managing memory more efficiently, it is possible to achieve substantial performance and
energy savings. Studies in high-performance computing and hyperscale infrastructure
suggest that system-level optimisation, spanning scheduling, data movement, memory
hierarchy, and power management, can meaningfully reduce AI workload energy
consumption, depending on the baseline and scope of measurement (Patterson et al., 2022;
Elsworth et al., 2025).
The efficiency of data centre infrastructure further shapes overall electricity demand. Best-
in-class hyperscale facilities now achieve power usage effectiveness (PUE) ratios of
approximately 1.1 to 1.2, compared with 1.5 to 1.7 in older or enterprise-operated sites.
Moving from a PUE of 1.6 to 1.2 can reduce non-IT energy consumption, such as cooling and
power distribution, by roughly two-thirds, with total reductions in energy use of around
one-quarter. Major cloud providers report sustained low PUE performance across hyperscale
fleets.

However, many of the most impactful efficiency levers are locked in at the design and
planning stage and are difficult or costly to retrofit. These include cooling architecture,
whether the facility supports liquid cooling, and the choice of location, which determines
how much of the year a site can rely on outside air for free cooling. This means that the PUE
performance of a facility is largely locked in at construction, and the installed base of less
efficient data centres will take years to turn over. More broadly, hardware and infrastructure
efficiency improvements, while foundational to long-term sustainability, are constrained by
capital investment cycles, supply chains for advanced semiconductors, and physical limits
such as power density and thermal management. Consequently, hardware efficiency gains
typically materialise more slowly at system scale than software-based improvements, even
though both remain critical to moderating AI-driven electricity demand.
2.3
Key takeaways
The balance of AI-related energy consumption has already shifted decisively from training to
inference. Yet even as per-unit efficiency continues to improve at a very rapid pace, several
concurrent trends in AI development are likely to drive growing energy consumption across
the sector. Rapid growth in overall AI usage could continue to offset efficiency gains. This is
compounded by the growing prevalence of advanced reasoning models, now widely

deployed across major platforms, which increase compute intensity per-task by generating
longer chains of inference and running multiple solution paths, thereby raising energy use
per query even as underlying hardware efficiency improves.
In the near term, this dynamic is likely to be amplified by the rapid evolution of AI systems
themselves. Multimodal AI models that integrate text, images, audio and video require
greater compute and memory bandwidth than single-modality systems. As these models
become more common across search, productivity tools and media generation, aggregate
inference demand per user interaction may rise even if per-operation efficiency improves.
At the same time, the rapid deployment of agentic AI – systems that are already available in
major platforms – is increasing compute intensity per-task. Unlike single-response systems,
agents plan, iterate, call tools and execute multi-step tasks autonomously in response to user
prompts, generating multiple internal reasoning steps, running simulations and performing
verification loops before producing an output. This increases total token generation, memory
usage and tool calls, raising energy consumption per completed task even if hardware
efficiency improves.
Finally, the integration of AI into physical systems, including robotics, autonomous vehicles,
industrial control and edge devices, will shift electricity demand beyond data centres.
Embodied and real-time systems require low-latency inference, continuous sensing and
on-device processing, which can multiply total deployment volumes. While individual edge
models may be optimised for efficiency, the sheer scale of deployment across vehicles,
factories, logistics networks and consumer devices can drive substantial aggregate electricity
demand, although the potential magnitude remains uncertain.
On the hardware side, emerging architectures may offer step-change improvements that go
beyond incremental gains. Three-dimensional chip stacking, which integrates memory and
compute layers vertically, can substantially reduce off-chip data movement, which accounts
for a growing share of AI system energy use. However, it comes at a cost of higher thermal
density and manufacturing complexity. Photonic interconnects, which replace electrical
signalling with lower-energy optical links, target similar bottlenecks at the chip-to-chip and
rack-to-rack levels. Co-packaged optics are already entering initial production for rack-to-
rack AI networking switches, with chip-to-chip deployment expected to follow from around
2027-2028, though the scale of their efficiency impact at the fleet level remains uncertain.
Taken together, these trends are not merely additive. Agentic systems that invoke
multimodal models and interface with physical systems create compounding compute
demand per-task, meaning the aggregate effect on energy consumption may exceed what
any single trend would suggest in isolation. As a result, the IEA’s electricity consumption
projections for data centres incorporate substantial improvements in energy efficiency over
time but still point to sharply rising electricity demand from AI in the near term.

Box 2.1 ⊳
How much compute does AI actually need?
The first official per-query energy disclosures from major AI companies paint a
surprisingly modest picture. Google reports that the median Gemini text prompt
consumes 0.24 Wh (Google, 2025b); OpenAI puts the average ChatGPT query at 0.34 Wh
(Altman, 2025); and a bottom-up estimation by Microsoft Research arrives at a median
of 0.34 Wh for frontier-scale models with over 200 billion parameters (Felipe Oviedo,
2025). These figures date from 2025 and are likely already lower. Google itself reported
a thirty-three-fold reduction in energy per prompt over the 12 months to May 2025,
driven by advances in model architecture and hardware. As inference optimisation and
next-generation accelerators continue to improve, per-query consumption can be
expected to fall further.
Even taking the 2025 figures at face value and allowing for a generous blended average
of 1 Wh to account for heavier workloads such as reasoning and multimodal generation,
scaling to 10 billion queries per day would imply annual electricity consumption of
roughly 3.6 TWh. To put this in perspective, 10 billion queries per day is comparable to
the estimated volume of all daily Internet searches worldwide (Felipe Oviedo, 2025) and
roughly four times ChatGPT's reported 2.5 billion daily prompts as of mid-2025
(TechCrunch, 2025). For context, this is less than 1% of the 485 TWh that data centres
consume today and would represent only a small draw on the tens of gigawatts of new
IT capacity that leading AI companies are individually seeking to secure.
This arithmetic raises a question that the available disclosures do not yet answer. If text-
based inference at massive scale would account for such a thin slice of projected
electricity demand, the bulk of planned capacity must be destined for other workloads,
such as large-scale model training, video and image generation, autonomous agents
running multi-step pipelines, or enterprise deployments not yet reflected in public usage
figures. Yet none of the companies that have disclosed per-query metrics have offered a
comparable breakdown of how their anticipated capacity will be allocated across these
categories, nor how per-query consumption is expected to evolve as agentic and
reasoning-intensive use cases become the norm. In practice, AI inference is diffusing
rapidly across the full spectrum of digital services, from search and recommendation
engines to customer support, public administration and autonomous multi-step agent
workflows. Understanding the composition of future AI electricity demand, not only the
cost of a single prompt today but the full mix of increasingly complex and embedded
workloads driving tomorrow’s infrastructure build-out, would give energy planners and
policy makers a much stronger basis for anticipating what lies ahead.

Are new data centres moving to locations beyond
existing clusters?
The world’s data centre capacity is heavily concentrated in clusters, driven by factors such as
local demand for IT services, the availability of digital and energy infrastructure, and tax and
other incentives. However, the clustering of data centres creates significant challenges for
utilities and grid operators. While data centres accounted for 1.5% of global electricity
consumption in 2025, they accounted for as much as 20-30% of electricity demand in the
states, metropolitan clusters or regions where these clusters exist, compounding the
challenge of meeting electricity demand reliably, quickly and affordably.
For example, in Alberta, Canada, government efforts to attract data centres led to connection
requests totalling 16 GW, which exceeded the province’s peak demand. This in turn
prompted the grid operator to impose a temporary 1.2 GW cap to protect system reliability
(AESO, 2025).
It is therefore vital to explore how the geographic distribution of data centres is evolving over
time. Specifically, is new data centre capacity set to continue expanding within existing hubs,
or will it become more widely distributed geographically?
Our analysis reveals that clusters are set to remain a key feature of the data centre landscape.
Existing hubs are poised to keep growing, while new data centre clusters are also emerging.
Trends differ by region, with capacity additions in advanced economies taking place in both
existing and new clusters, while emerging and developing economies are experiencing their
first wave of clustering.
3.1
Global data centre clustering patterns
In analysing clustering patterns, we assessed both data centre capacity that is already under
construction and capacity that has been announced but is not yet under construction, which
together we refer to as capacity in the pipeline. Announced projects do not always break
ground or lead to completed projects. Pipeline estimates are derived from third-party project
databases and include only projects that have progressed to a credible stage.
Globally, existing data centre capacity is primarily concentrated in major hubs. Established
clusters in the United States, Europe and China, where data centres benefit from robust grid
infrastructure, reliable power supply, skilled labour and proximity to demand, represent
more than half of global capacity today. For the purposes of this analysis, data centre clusters
refer to collections of facilities with a combined total designed capacity of at least 500 MW
within any 100 km radius.
The analysis reveals that, at the global level, over half of all data centres in the pipeline are
situated in existing clusters, including around 65% of the data centres under construction
and nearly 55% of those announced but not yet under construction. At the same time, a
growing share of new capacity will form entirely new clusters (Figure 3.1).

collections of facilities with a total designed capacity of 500 MW and grouped according to the DBSCAN
clustering algorithm using a neighbourhood radius of 100 km.
Source: IEA analysis based on BNEF (2025).
Taken together, the share of data centre capacity located in clusters, both existing and new,
is therefore set to rise from around 60% today to over 65% by the time facilities currently
under construction come online. Factoring in all announced projects, that share rises further
to more than 70%, although it is again important to highlight that not all announced projects
actually come to fruition.
Regions where data centres are already an established sector (mostly advanced economies
and China) are seeing growth in existing hubs and the establishment of new ones.
Meanwhile, in developing economies, new clusters are beginning to emerge. Across regions,
clustering is a common feature, with the exception of the Middle East and Africa.
Europe’s pipeline shows the greatest geographic diversification. Current data centre clusters
in Europe include Frankfurt, London, Amsterdam, Paris and Dublin, often referred to as
FLAP-D. Within the data centre pipeline, capacity is set to be relatively less clustered in
Europe than in the United States and Asia. Nonetheless, the share of total data centre
capacity in clusters in Europe is set to exceed 50%, including new clusters that will be created
by future capacity additions.

Box 3.1 ⊳ Physical security as an emerging determinant of data centre location
As AI becomes increasingly integral to economies, data centres are now regarded as vital
strategic assets with security implications. Conventional security risks to data centres
range from cybersecurity breaches to supply chain vulnerabilities – including those
related to energy infrastructure and critical mineral supply. This was explored in IEA’s
2025 special report Energy and AI.
More recently, as the 2026 conflict in the Middle East has highlighted, conventional
physical threats have emerged as a key risk to data centre infrastructure. Data centres
have joined energy and telecommunications infrastructure as potential sources of
vulnerability. This risk is especially acute for large data centres that involve capital
expenditures to the tune of billions of dollars. For example, some of the largest data
centres in construction today have USD 20-50 billion in planned investment outlay. This
might have implications on the locational considerations of data centres – which in turn
have implications on energy demand in those regions.
This issue might have additional considerations as 60% of the world population today
resides in countries that account for just 9% of data centre capacity. As a result, countries
have put in place policies such as tax incentives and data localisation rules to encourage
investment into new data centre capacity in their jurisdictions. With physical security of
data centres as a consideration, there could be implications for some regions seeking to
attract new investment.
The IEA is tracking this issue closely and will continue to factor in traditional and non-
traditional security threats into its analysis on data centre locations and the resulting
energy demand.
3.2
Data centre clustering in the United States
The United States is the world’s largest data centre market, accounting for about half of total
global installed capacity as well as announced global capacity additions. North America is the
most clustered region, along with Asia. Factoring in the data centre capacity in the pipeline,
the United States has the largest capacity in clusters, both existing and new. There are also
reports of very large volumes of interconnection requests in existing clusters in the
United States. For example, ERCOT, the grid operator in Texas, has received interconnection
requests of 160 GW from data centres (Utility Dive, 2026), which is twice the existing global
capacity of hyperscale and colocation data centres. However, it is worth noting that not all
interconnection requests result in approvals and subsequent construction, and some of the
requests may be speculative in nature (see Box 3.2).
Our analysis suggests that future capacity additions in the United States will be increasingly
concentrated in existing and new cluster areas. However, national statistics hide significant
regional differences, with a few states accounting for most of the capacity growth
(Figure 3.2). For instance, in states such as Virginia and Ohio, nearly all future capacity will

expand existing clusters. In particular, Northern Virginia, the world’s most significant area for
data centre development, is set to see concentrated growth, with practically all projects in
the pipeline located within or immediately adjacent to the established cluster, benefiting
from the extensive communications infrastructure already in place. Texas, however, will see
most additional capacity concentrated in new clusters of different sizes near cities such as
Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin, where land availability, competitive power supply
and growing technology sectors are attracting investment. Emerging clusters in Texas also
extend beyond population centres into areas close to energy resources and supportive
infrastructure.

away from cities?
Geospatial analysis of data centres around the world conducted for the IEA’s 2025 special

(IEA, 2025a). As urban areas are already major centres of energy demand, new data
centres can present a challenge to utilities.

train and run AI models. They tend to have a much larger associated capacity, and
therefore electricity consumption, than typical colocation or enterprise data centres and
are equipped with the latest hardware and technology (see section 4). Given the
demands of competition in the AI industry, they are also expected to be constructed
rapidly.
To understand their locational characteristics and the progress of their build-out, the IEA
conducted a geospatial analysis of 21 such AI-focused large data centres. These data
centres range 600 MW to 5 GW in nameplate capacity and are each estimated to
consume as much electricity as 600 000 to 5 million households once complete.
IEA analysis revealed that 19 of these 21 hyperscale AI data centres in the United States
are located within 65 km of the centre of a city with a population of at least
100 000 people. Their construction is also progressing rapidly, having tripled in floor
space and estimated capacity within 18 months to exceed 6 GW cumulatively. The
analysis highlights that while AI data centres display a greater degree of locational
flexibility than traditional data centres, they still tend to cluster close to urban areas.
Once completed, in many cases, the power demand of these data centres will dwarf that
of the adjacent urban areas. This fact, combined with their rapid development timelines,
can put pressure on local grids and utilities.

Key takeaways
Based on this analysis, the geographic concentration of data centres appears set to persist
and intensify, with existing clusters continuing to attract a large share of future capacity
additions. Among projects located outside current hubs, an increasing share will form new
clusters rather than being widely dispersed, reflecting the sector’s tendency towards
agglomeration. As the average size of data centres increases, fewer facilities are able to add
large capacities near existing hubs, which supports the creation of new clusters. While
patterns vary by region, the global trend points towards a world in which data centre capacity
remains spatially concentrated, albeit across a growing number of hubs.

Powering data centres

How is AI changing data centre design, and what does it
mean for the mix of energy technologies in them?
There are many types of data centres, ranging from small enterprise facilities to those that
provide digital services, such as cloud applications or web hosting, and large hyperscale
facilities. Until now, very few data centres have been specifically built to serve AI model
training and use. However, booming demand for AI services is leading to a new generation
of data centres specifically designed and optimised for AI, so-called “AI factories”. While
these AI factories can vary in their technical specifications and business models, they face a
shared set of technical challenges and rely on an emerging, highly specialised technology
stack. Mapping their development is important for understanding how this type of data
centre might integrate into the grid in the future, along with the implications for energy
technology supply chains and possible innovation spillovers for the rest of the energy system.
AI factories are characterised by soaring power densities and sharp swings in IT load
Two trends make AI factories different from traditional data centres. First, they are becoming
increasingly power-dense, meaning they have higher power demand per unit of space.
Second, they tend to house much more variable electrical loads. The first trend is driven by
the growing power rating of chips (i.e. GPUs), as well as by the clustering of more chips into
a single rack.4 Multiple chips are networked tightly together to function effectively as a single
computer. This trend is driven by the need to increase computing power and memory while
minimising both electrical losses and data latency. The power requirements of the associated
auxiliary equipment must also increase to maintain optimal conditions for the higher power
density of the IT equipment. For instance, since more heat is generated at the rack level,
cooling equipment must scale accordingly.
For example, Nvidia’s Ampere architecture from 2020 had a rated power of around 400 W
per chip and clustered 32 chips per rack, resulting in a power density of around 13 kW per
rack, including central processing unit, networking and storage power. The current Blackwell
architecture has a rated power of 1 000 W per chip and 72 chips per rack, with a power
density of 130 kW per rack. The announced Rubin architecture will reach a power density of
600 kW per rack and will pave the way for 1 MW per rack density. To put this in perspective,
with the announced Rubin architecture, a box the size of a household fridge would have a
peak power draw equivalent to that of around 65 households. This rate of increase in power
density has no historical precedent in electrical engineering.

One consequence of GPUs being networked together and operated synchronously is that
their workloads, and therefore their power consumption, are also synchronised. During AI
model training and use, there are typically periods of intense computation, followed by
periods of less computationally intensive data exchange and periods of computational
downtime. Because computation requires power, this variability leads to large swings in IT
power demand. These swings occur across timeframes ranging from microseconds to
seconds to several minutes. As the power density of AI hardware increases, the absolute size
of these swings also increases. Software-based mitigation strategies can help smooth these
swings, but they may result in more wasteful electricity consumption. Depending on how
data centres of this kind are configured and connected to the grid, these swings in power use
may have implications for grid stability, potentially leading to voltage instability and
harmonic distortion on local grids.

Implications for power delivery, storage and cooling technologies
This change in architecture has major implications for the technology stack needed by
next-generation AI factories, which may in turn have broader spillovers for the energy sector.

power losses5 and generate substantial amounts of heat, which would need to be managed
in addition to the heat produced by the IT equipment. Power delivery infrastructure would
also occupy as much space within the data centre as the compute infrastructure itself. This
would result in facilities that are expensive, less energy efficient, wasteful of critical materials
such as copper wiring, more complicated to build and operate, and less scalable.
Some of these challenges can be addressed by increasing the voltage from the standard
400 volts to 800 volts, and possibly even higher, and by shifting from alternating current (AC)
to direct current (DC). Doubling the voltage means that the size of a copper cable for power
distribution can be reduced by a factor of four while transmitting the same amount of power,
while moving from AC to DC reduces the number of power conversion steps from the grid to
the chip, limiting conversion losses. This architecture can build upon innovations in power
conversion and control technologies pioneered by the electric vehicle and renewables
industries. Critical technologies include:

Rectifiers and solid-state transformers. These devices can convert grid AC power to DC
power, control voltage for distribution across the data centre and provide power quality.
Solid-state transformers have a 70% lower material footprint than traditional
transformers, much higher flexibility and precision in terms of power control, and higher
power conversion efficiency. However, current designs often face higher thermal
management requirements and lower peak efficiency compared to high-efficiency
liquid-filled transformers. Solid-state transformers are also still at an early phase of
commercialisation.

Power electronics, or the use of semiconductors for efficient power conversion and
control. This technology enables voltage step-up or step-down, dynamic load balancing
to maintain stable voltages, and microsecond-sensitive fault management, which is
essential for safety in DC architectures and critical for protecting the extremely
expensive IT equipment in AI factories. Critical technologies include silicon carbide and
gallium nitride based power electronics.
Power storage technologies are also critical for next-generation data centres due to the load
variability of increasingly large and powerful GPU clusters noted above. For example, AI data
centres have seen oscillations of tens of megawatts (around half of rated capacity) in less
than a second (Elevate Energy Consulting, 2025). If left unmitigated, this can damage
equipment within a data centre and cause voltage and harmonic disturbance at the grid level.
To mitigate these swings, storage is needed across multiple timeframes, from milliseconds
to minutes or more. For millisecond timeframes, electrolytic capacitors can deliver or absorb
power, smoothing the extreme cycling speeds of GPUs while protecting battery systems from
the degradation caused by frequent charging and discharging. For longer timeframes,
lithium-ion batteries, potentially complemented by sodium-ion batteries in the future, can

smooth GPU ramp cycles, provide backup power in the event of an outage of the prime
power source and enable a data centre to provide flexibility to the grid. This can help
facilitate grid connections and make data centres more grid-friendly assets, protecting the
grid from the voltage and harmonic disturbances that unmitigated load swings within a data
centre could otherwise cause.

The increase in power density within AI factories inevitably results in additional heat that
must be removed to ensure that servers remain within their operating temperature range.
High-density AI racks increasingly require liquid cooling solutions, which leverage the fact
that liquids can carry much more heat than air. Liquid cooling solutions could also make it
easier to recover waste heat.

Key takeaways
The challenges and innovations described in this section relate to the next generation of
AI-optimised data centres. They are not necessarily relevant for all data centres, many of
which will continue to use more traditional architectures or adopt hybrid approaches, with
some computing space dedicated to AI-optimised infrastructure and some occupied by more
traditional computing infrastructure. Even for AI-optimised infrastructure, transitional
architectures centred around the delivery of 400-volt AC power will continue to be used.
However, if future generations of ultra-high-power-density servers are deployed at scale in
the next few years, the cost and technical limitations of traditional architectures will create
strong incentives to change approaches. The size of AI factories means that these shifts in
the technology stack could have broader implications for the energy sector. We explore
several here, while highlighting that this is a fast-moving field that requires further analysis
and closer co-operation between energy technology providers and the technology sector.

For several of the technological solutions outlined, there are supply chain concerns, whether
in terms of technology readiness, supply chain bottlenecks or supply chain concentration.
While the underlying technology of power electronics is well proven, large-scale solid-state
transformers are not yet commercially available, and their deployment is limited to niche
applications. Bottlenecks across the supply chain include grain-oriented steel; a severe global
shortage of specialised power system engineers, site technicians and skilled labour, for
example in transformer manufacturing; and limited production capacity for silicon carbide-
based power electronics. Several aspects of the supply chain also show a high degree of
geographic concentration, notably in China (see Table 4.1).
The extremely rapid shift towards new, more power-intensive data centre designs is set to
test the ability of related supply chains to scale. At the same time, this transition in power
architecture is likely to bring broader benefits to the energy system by accelerating the
commercialisation and innovation of electrical technologies such as solid-state transformers.
The shift towards actively managing variable power loads within the data centre through the
deployment of battery storage systems with grid-interactive capabilities could also
contribute to making data centres more grid-interactive and flexible in the future, providing
both stability and flexibility to the network.

How are data centre operators procuring the electricity
they need?
Growing electricity demand from data centres is pushing operators to secure rapid and
cost‑effective access to power while also meeting corporate emissions reduction and clean
energy targets. To meet these objectives, operators are adopting a range of procurement
strategies.
One of the most prominent approaches is the corporate power purchase agreement (PPA),
which allows companies to contract electricity directly from generators and lock in long‑term
electricity supply. In the past few years, in addition to PPAs with wind, solar and hydro
generators, major data centre operators have also signed PPAs to secure baseload
low-emissions electricity from nuclear and geothermal sources. At the same time, natural
gas is attracting greater attention as a dispatchable and cost-competitive source of electricity
that can support rising power demand from data centres, particularly in the United States.
5.1
Procurement strategies
PPAs have become one of the main procurement strategies for data centre operators since
they allow them not only to buy electricity at a fixed price to meet demand but also to
procure electricity from specific sources to help companies achieve their clean energy goals.
However, even when data centres purchase low-emissions electricity via PPAs, that
electricity may not be located near the data centres and may not be generated at the specific
times when it is needed. Therefore, the actual power use by data centres is often met by the
grid using other sources, such as natural gas or coal. This results in a physical electricity mix
that often differs from the procured, or “financial”, electricity mix.
To account for this discrepancy, some data centre operators are moving from annual to
hourly matching of low-emissions electricity. This approach seeks to ensure that electricity
demand in each hour of the year is met with low-emissions generation, rather than offset
through annual volumes. Achieving hourly matching often requires pairing variable
renewables, such as wind and solar PV, with storage systems, typically battery storage,
although other dispatchable low-emissions sources, such as hydropower, nuclear or
geothermal, can also contribute. Technology companies such as Google and Microsoft have
set targets to achieve hourly matched supply with low-emissions electricity by 2030,
signalling momentum behind this approach. For example, Google developed partnerships
with NV Energy and Xcel Energy to bring new low-emissions electricity under the Clean
Transition Tariff and Clean Energy Accelerator Charge.
IEA analysis indicates that portfolios achieving up to 80% hourly matching using wind, solar
PV and batteries can be broadly cost-competitive with annual matching portfolios (IEA,
2025a). While achieving nearly full hourly matching typically involves a cost premium
compared with annual PPAs, mainly due to the need to incorporate storage technologies, it
reduces exposure to electricity price volatility and offers protection for consumers against
high market prices.

In recent years, data centres have increasingly adopted PPAs that specifically include
renewable energy sources. Agreements covering more than 40 TWh were signed in 2025,
with around 40% of this volume in the United States (Figure 5.1). Over the past five years,
about 65% of renewable PPAs signed in the United States have been specifically dedicated
to data centre operations. Renewable PPAs for data centres have also expanded in Europe,
rising from about 1.5 TWh in 2021 to nearly 15 TWh in 2025, with data centre PPAs now
accounting for more than 30% of the total volume of electricity contracted through corporate
renewable PPAs. The trend is less prominent, but still significant, in the rest of the world,
with about 20% of renewable PPAs dedicated for data centre operations. By 2027, electricity
contracted through renewable PPAs is projected to be equivalent to 50% of total commercial
data centre electricity demand, a significant increase from less than 20% in 2021.

As baseload low-emissions technologies, nuclear and geothermal power have gained
increasing attention in recent years. For example, in 2024, Microsoft and Constellation
announced a PPA to procure about 835 MW of nuclear capacity through the restart of Three
Mile Island Unit 1, with the restart currently targeted for 2027. In 2025, Amazon Web
Services entered into a PPA with Talen Energy to supply its data centres with up to 1 920 MW
of power from Talen’s Susquehanna nuclear power plant. Major technology companies are
also supporting the development and commercialisation of innovative low-emissions
technologies, particularly small modular reactors (SMRs) and next-generation geothermal.

25 GW of SMR capacity had been announced by the end of 2024 to supply data centre
operations (IEA, 2025a). A further 20 GW was announced in January 2026, raising the total
planned capacity to 45 GW, while many other announced projects have yet to specify
capacity. The first commercial SMRs are expected to start operating around 2030. Meta has

New natural gas capacity will help meet surging electricity demand
While the substantial growth in renewables and low-emissions electricity, such as nuclear
and geothermal, reflects strong efforts by data centre operators to align growth with their
clean energy objectives, fossil fuels continue to play a significant role in meeting the sector’s
rapidly rising electricity demand.
Over 100 GW of new natural gas capacity is currently planned as dedicated supply for data
centres through onsite generation, including projects that have been announced or are in
the pre-construction or construction stages (Figure 5.3). Most of this new capacity is in the
United States, where more than one-third of all new global gas-fired capacity is intended to
supply onsite electricity for data centre operations. The trend is different outside the
United States, where only around 13 GW of onsite gas capacity has been announced or is
under development. Even so, it remains uncertain how much of the global pipeline will
ultimately be built (see section 6).

Key takeaways
With global electricity generation for data centres projected to double to over 1 000 TWh by
2030, generation from all sources is set to increase. Renewables are poised to account for a
substantial share of this growth, expanding by more than 200 TWh from current levels and
reaching 360 TWh by 2030, at which point they would account for more than one-third of
the sector’s total generation. The growing pipeline of natural gas-fired projects means that

gas generation is also projected to increase strongly, particularly in the United States. It is set
to more than double to around 340 TWh by 2030, pushing its share of the global data centre
electricity mix to around 30%. Together, renewables and natural gas are set to account for
over 65% of all electricity produced for data centres by 2030.

Nuclear sources are projected to increase their generation for data centres from around
75 TWh today to nearly 120 TWh in 2030. Meanwhile, coal continues to supply electricity to
data centres, primarily in China, and is projected to account for about 20% of the global data
centre electricity supply in 2030.

Why are some data centre developers considering
onsite generation?
Today, most data centres are connected to the grid. However, given lengthy connection
queues, onsite electricity generation is gaining interest. Onsite generation has the potential
to provide faster access to power for data centres in regions with constrained grids. However,
because of design complexity given the high requirements for reliability, as well as increasing
component costs and growing backlogs in the gas turbine supply chain, onsite power can
raise costs for developers and increase project timelines.
To date, the largest data centre project using onsite generation as its primary source of
electricity is in Tennessee (United States), which initially deployed more than 400 MW of
onsite natural gas turbines to bridge supply in 2024 and 2025. This was later scaled down as
a 150 MW grid connection (with 150 MW of backup battery storage) came online. However,
the pipeline of data centre projects with onsite generation is expanding rapidly, with larger,
gigawatt-scale projects currently under development.
So far, onsite generation projects are concentrated almost entirely in the United States and,
as with the Tennessee project, are based largely on natural gas-fired technology. Around
5.6 GW of onsite gas-fired capacity for data centres is currently under construction, more
than 70 GW is in development and an additional 21 GW has been proposed (GEM, 2025).

Since the IEA’s 2025 Energy and AI report, new analysis of onsite power projects for data
centres using satellite imagery has shed further light on the evolution of this pipeline. In total,
63 power plants were trackable, accounting for 50 GW of the more than 75 GW pipeline. The
analysis shows that construction has not yet started at most sites, although some projects
have advanced relatively rapidly. In February 2025, nearly 90% of identified capacity
remained at the pre-construction stage, while only 1% had begun site preparation, 6% had
visible structures and 5% were nearing completion. By February 2026, pre-construction
capacity had declined to 75%, while capacity under site preparation rose to 10% and capacity
with visible structures to 11%. Completed capacity remained at the same level seen in early
2025.
6.1
Key considerations for onsite generation
In some areas, AI infrastructure is expanding faster than electricity networks can connect
new load. Lengthy grid connection queues and grid expansion timelines are colliding with
data centre delivery cycles of one to two years, turning electricity availability into a binding
constraint on deployment.
As a result, an increasing number of developers are planning data centres with onsite power
generation. Some are pursuing hybrid models, in which onsite generation and storage
complement a grid connection. Others are proposing onsite generation as a temporary
“bridge to power” while projects wait for a grid connection, and plan to later repurpose these
assets for backup or flexibility services once full grid access becomes available. Another
solution, as developers seek to shorten timelines, has been to co‑locate new data centre
loads near existing grid‑connected power plants.
As noted, natural gas-fired technologies dominate the onsite generation pipeline,
particularly aeroderivative gas turbines and large reciprocating engines, which combine fast
start‑up times, high ramp rates and modularity with high power density. Where possible,
some developers are also deploying onsite fuel cells, particularly in areas with stricter limits
on noise and air pollution, as well as renewables, including solar PV, wind and geothermal.
Data centres require highly reliable power, typically targeting 99.999% to 99.9999% uptime.
However, the reliability of grid electricity varies significantly across regions. In advanced
economies, annual average outages can amount to just a few minutes in the most reliable
systems but can extend to 5 to 10 hours in areas with weaker grids or higher exposure to
natural disasters. Even in this worst-case scenario, this equates to reliability of between
99.94% and 99.89%, and grid-connected data centres can reach their reliability targets by
complementing grid power with backup storage, through uninterrupted power supply (UPS)
systems, and backup generators.
Achieving grid‑like reliability through onsite power generation alone is more challenging.
Operational data indicate that annual gas turbine reliability6 generally ranges from 85% to

6 This is the fraction of the year a unit is technically available to generate when called upon, considering
unplanned forced outages and scheduled maintenance downtime.

95%. To ensure continuous power for a 1 GW data centre in an advanced economy at the
necessary reliability levels, onsite generation capacity must be oversized to roughly 1.3 GW
to 1.7 GW or more, allowing multiple units to be offline while still meeting the full load.
Reliability requirements favour the use of smaller, modular generators, as smaller unit sizes
limit the impact of individual unit failures and reduce the reserve capacity needed to achieve
a given reliability threshold. Turbine reliability is a key determinant of the required overbuild.
Using turbines with an availability of 85% instead of 95%, for example, can increase necessary
capacity by 25-45%, depending on the size of the unit and the target level of supply reliability
(Figure 6.2). However, this overbuild primarily guards against turbine failure modes that are
independent. Onsite units supplied by a single gas pipeline remain exposed to fuel supply
interruptions that can affect all turbines simultaneously. Mitigating this risk may require
additional measures, such as deploying turbines with dual‑fuel capability and onsite liquid
fuel storage, or dedicated additional diesel backup generation.
Figure 6.2 ⊳
Installed gas turbine capacity and levelised cost of electricity for
powering a 1 GW data centre at different reliability levels
IEA. CC BY 4.0.
Onsite generation can help bypass grid connection queues, but achieving grid‑level
reliability requires redundancy, making it more expensive than grid power in many cases
Notes: Assumes a turbine efficiency of 40%, a weighted average cost of capital of 7%, a data centre load factor
of 70%, and operation and maintenance costs of 20 USD/kW/year. Capital costs are 2 500 USD/kW for 50 MW,
2 000 USD/kW for 100 MW, 1 650 USD/kW for 200 MW, and 1 450 USD/kW for 300 MW turbines.
The fixed costs associated with this overbuild strongly influence project economics. Capital
expenditures and fixed operation and maintenance costs for seldom‑used standby capacity
are spread over the same energy output, pushing up the levelised cost of electricity
(Figure 6.2). Recent increases in gas turbine capital costs, driven by rising component prices,
full order books and growing backlogs, add further upward pressure. As a result, even with

low-cost natural gas of around USD 4/MBtu and very high turbine reliability of 95%, the
levelised cost of electricity for onsite power would sit above typical grid electricity prices for
large industrial loads in much of the United States. These can be as low as USD 60/MWh in
some US states, including Louisiana and Texas.
Lower turbine reliability raises costs further. At 85% availability, levelised costs rise to roughly
USD 180/MWh to USD 220/MWh, significantly above prevailing prices for grid electricity. In
Europe, higher natural gas prices (TTF averaged around USD 12/MBtu in 2025) make
gas-based onsite generation significantly more expensive than in the United States, with
levelised costs approaching USD 190/MWh to USD 300/MWh for reliability levels that match
those of local grids. This is well above the USD 150/MWh paid on average by industrial end
users across the European Union. This is a key reason why onsite natural gas power projects
for data centres are concentrated almost exclusively in the United States today.
Gas-based onsite generation is not only typically more expensive than grid electricity for data
centres but also entails significantly greater planning, permitting and operational burdens.
Moreover, long and increasing lead times for gas turbines (Box 6.1), combined with complex
permitting and construction processes and, in some regions, constraints on available gas
pipeline capacity, mean that deploying onsite generation may not ultimately be faster than
waiting for a grid connection.
Box 6.1 ⊳
The boom in natural gas turbine orders and growing waiting times
In 2025, global orders of natural gas turbines reached the second-highest level on record
and their highest point in 25 years. AI and data centres were only one of the drivers of
this surge.
Companies outside the United States accounted for nearly 60% of the global market and
increased orders by one-third in 2025 relative to 2024. Except in a few countries, such as
Ireland and Malaysia, data centres have not been a major driver in electricity demand
growth among this group and therefore were not the direct cause of the jump in turbine
orders.
Meanwhile, within the United States, data centres were an important contributor, both
directly and indirectly, to the sharp increase in turbine orders. Utilities have been aiming
to mitigate growing concerns over capacity adequacy as loads increase and reserve
margins shrink, and in hotspot regions such as Texas and Virginia, data centre load growth
is likely a major factor. At the same time, data centre developers looking to procure
onsite prime or backup power have also been placing orders. Of the roughly 54 GW of
turbines ordered by stakeholders in the United States in 2025, around 10% were tracked
as intended to power data centres directly. An additional 24 GW of orders are in US states
characterised by high existing or fast-growing data centre load. This suggests that data
centre load growth may be a factor behind these orders, but it is also important to note
that orders also rose sharply in US states that do not host significant data centre capacity.
A broader trend of electrification, industrial reshoring and data centre load growth is at
play.

A scarcity mentality has also taken hold, with companies rushing to lock in orders in
advance as wait times extend to five years or more and prices jump. Currently, the
leading producers have a combined manufacturing capacity of around 50 GW to 60 GW
per year, implying a growing backlog at current order levels. While they are expanding
manufacturing capacity, it will take time for this additional output to come online.
Working through the current backlog and meeting future orders will therefore take time.

Operational challenges of supplying electricity to data centres
Data centres are often viewed as stable, near-constant baseload electricity consumers. In
many conventional facilities, this characterisation holds true. However, as computing needs
evolve, particularly with the rapid expansion of AI, the operational requirements for
supplying electricity to data centres are becoming more complex (see section 4). These shifts
introduce new challenges for both grid-connected facilities and sites relying on onsite
generation.
AI is changing data centre load profiles and making electricity storage an essential tool
A key emerging challenge is the increasing speed at which electricity demand can vary within
modern data centres. AI and other compute-intensive workloads can trigger steep and
sudden load ramps as clusters of GPUs transition synchronously between tasks. These
transitions can cause power demand to swing within fractions of a second, far faster than
traditional onsite generation technologies such as diesel generators or gas turbines can
respond. One documented case showed that a data centre block focused on AI training

experienced a rapid load increase from 6 MW to 30 MW in just 0.25 seconds (Elevate Energy
Consulting, 2025). It would be impossible for onsite generation to follow such fast load
swings without the help of other technologies. A typical aeroderivative gas turbine requires
around 5 minutes to reach full output after start-up and can then ramp at around 50% of
nominal capacity per minute.
Where a data centre is connected to the grid, such load fluctuations, without sufficient
buffering, could propagate to the grid and affect power quality at the distribution level,
particularly in regions where data centres are clustered. In response to this challenge, grid
operators have begun publishing ramp‑rate requirements for large loads. For onsite
generation, rapid load swings may strain equipment, reduce efficiency or be simply too fast
for onsite units to respond in time.
As a result, operators are increasingly deploying hybrid control systems that combine UPS
units, battery energy storage systems, battery backup units on rack and capacitors to absorb
rapid load swings. These systems help prevent short-duration fluctuations from propagating
back into the grid or to onsite generation equipment. They are likely to play a crucial role in
enabling onsite systems to overcome the operational challenges of meeting data centre
loads. Hardware and software solutions at the GPU and rack levels are also emerging as
complementary approaches to managing AI load variability, although they may also involve
wasteful “compute burn” to smooth rapid swings in compute demand, as noted in section 4.
Increasingly, battery energy storage systems are emerging as a key enabling technology for
AI data centres. They are often described as the system’s “multi‑tool” due to their
operational versatility as a complement to grid or onsite generation and as a lever for load-
management. In data centres with onsite power, batteries can provide fast‑acting reserve
capacity by bridging periods when demand ramps up or down more quickly than onsite
generation units can respond. This includes covering start‑up delays, managing controlled
shutdowns or absorbing short‑duration fluctuations. The ability of battery systems to deliver
near‑instantaneous power allows them to smooth load profiles, reducing cycling stress and
improving operational stability. In addition, these systems can enhance power quality by
providing frequency support and harmonic mitigation, thereby limiting adverse impacts on
gas turbines, reciprocating engines and other onsite power assets.
Overprovisioning and underutilised infrastructure
Another characteristic of data centres is the difference between the actual power
consumption of IT and auxiliary equipment and their theoretical maximum design capacity.
As data centres are designed to ensure high reliability, meet stringent redundancy
requirements and accommodate future demand growth, most operate below their
maximum design capacity for much of their lifetime. The Electric Power Research Institute
reports that the hyperscale facilities it examined operated at an average annual capacity
factor of 75% of their grid-connected capacity, compared with 57% across smaller co‑location
facilities (EPRI, 2026). While load shapes vary by workload and data centre tenant mix, peak
demand often remains meaningfully below nameplate capacity.

While this underutilisation increases costs, it also provides valuable headroom to absorb
sudden load changes without breaching equipment limits. From an operational perspective,
this flexibility acts as an internal buffer, reducing the risk that rapid demand swings translate
into power quality issues or grid disturbances. However, this also raises additional challenges
for powering data centres with onsite power. Scaling onsite power equipment over time as
the IT load ramps up may not be possible if, for example, supply chain bottlenecks require
the upfront procurement of turbines. At the same time, overprovisioning onsite power
infrastructure may further raise costs.

Key takeaways
In many regions, data centre expansion is outpacing power grid development, prompting
some developers to consider onsite generation, primarily natural gas in the United States, to
secure faster access to electricity and mitigate grid delays. However, many of these projects
are still at an early stage of development. Many developers are pursuing hybrid solutions
that combine onsite generation and storage with grid connectivity, possibly repurposing
assets as backups once connected. Onsite generation adds technical and economic
challenges. Project outcomes therefore remain uncertain, but reasonable estimates can help
inform system operators and suppliers.

20 GW of data centre demand once reliability‑driven overbuild requirements are considered
(Figure 6.4). In the United States, where this growth is mostly concentrated, we project that
onsite projects could cover 6-13% of total growth in data centre capacity to 2030.
Onsite battery systems are crucial for data centre power supply reliability, providing short-
term backup through UPS units in both grid-connected and off-grid setups. By 2030, global
data centre UPS capacity is expected to rise by more than 100 GW, broadly matching the
growth in data centre infrastructure. Lithium-ion options are gaining ground due to longer
lifespans, compact size and better performance.
Beyond UPS, longer-duration battery energy storage systems are increasingly being deployed
to smooth loads within data centres and provide flexibility to the grid. As of 2025, around
5 GW of dedicated onsite battery storage capacity is operational at data centres worldwide.
We project that global installed capacity of longer-duration battery energy storage in data
centres will rise from around 5 GW today to 20-25 GW by 2030. The majority of this will be
in the United States, where onsite battery storage in data centres is expected to reach
10-12 GW by 2030, compared with more than 90 GW of grid-connected utility-scale battery
storage. This highlights that data centre battery storage could become an important grid
asset if the incentives are right, helping both to smooth internal load swings and support the
flexibility of the grid.

What are financial markets telling us about the impact
of AI on the energy sector?
AI was a central theme in financial markets in 2025, with an early surge of capital market
enthusiasm gradually shifting towards a more cautious and discerning outlook in the second
half of the year. While the long‑term trajectory of AI remains uncertain, continued uptake
will require more energy for data centres, and some areas of the energy sector appear to be
growing partly in response to expectations of higher data centre electricity demand. To this
extent, financial markets may capture important information about the perceived impacts of
AI and the build-out of data centres on the energy sector. This section examines the
relationship between the equity market performance of energy and AI companies, how
significant that relationship is and what it implies for the broader energy system.
7.1
Which energy market segments have benefited from the AI boom?
Market capitalisation reflects the collective assessment made by investors of a company’s
current business fundamentals and future prospects. Notably, since the release of
public-facing AI applications in late 2022, which marked the emergence of this new era of
modern AI, the shares of energy firms overall have increased for most sectors, though not at
the same pace as the broader market or AI-related technology companies.
The combined market capitalisation of a broad basket of utilities, oil and gas companies,
clean energy companies and battery storage manufacturers has grown moderately
compared with AI‑related technology companies (Figure 7.1). Moreover, growth across
these different segments of the energy sector was generally stronger before the launch of
ChatGPT than in the period since. Between December 2022 and January 2026, the market
capitalisation of electric utilities located outside of data centre hotspots in the United States,
for example, increased by 17%, compared with an increase of more than 70% in the
benchmark S&P 500 Index. Utilities operating specifically in data centre hotspots in the
United States saw their market capitalisation increase by around 38% over the same period.
That said, other pockets of the energy system, including gas turbine and grid equipment
manufacturers, fuel cell and geothermal companies, United States-based nuclear companies
and, to a lesser extent, pure-play natural gas companies, have seen their market
capitalisations grow at a faster rate since the launch of ChatGPT. For certain subsectors, the
increase has been so large that it exceeds, in percentage terms, the growth in market
capitalisation for AI-related companies over the same period. Some of this growth is
attributable to the data centre boom. For example, growing interest in the use of
aeroderivative gas turbines7 for captive power generation is a new phenomenon, as is the
signing by technology companies of power purchase or other agreements for nuclear energy.
At the same time, other factors, such as growing electricity demand in other end-use sectors,

for rapid start-up, high efficiency and flexible power generation.

macroeconomic trends and major policy shifts, cannot be discounted as also playing a
significant role.

Given these interlocking dynamics, we examined whether co-movement between AI and
energy stocks had strengthened while controlling for some structural market variables and
policy shifts (Figure 7.2). This analysis found no statistically significant change in the degree
of co-movement between AI and energy stocks for most segments of the energy sector
between the public launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 and January 2026, including for
United States-based utilities. In contrast, the degree of co-movement among gas turbine and
grid equipment manufacturers and US nuclear companies was the most pronounced.
The analysis provides evidence of a stronger linkage in market sentiment between certain
segments of the energy sector and AI-related companies. However, it does not attribute their
financial performance solely to the AI data centre boom, especially in light of concurrent

How does increased exposure to market sentiment towards AI create
opportunities or risks for the energy sector?
A company’s valuation affects its ability to raise capital. A higher valuation makes it easier
for companies to issue equity or borrow to finance new investments. Conversely, declining
valuations make equity issuance more dilutive and worsen leverage ratios. This can trigger
adverse debt covenants, raise borrowing costs and make refinancing more challenging.

Capital expenditures on energy equipment, such as backup power units, uninterrupted
power supply units and grid connections, represent a relatively small share of data centre
investment in any scenario (Figure 7.3). Investment in non-energy components, such as IT
equipment, accounts for 80% of total data centre investment in the Base Case. Yet, with
cumulative investments measured in trillions of dollars, even the small share of energy
investment in the total is potentially significant. In absolute terms, the difference in energy-
related investment between the highest and lowest IEA cases is more than USD 500 billion.

A pullback in the data centre build-out could, in theory, lead to stranded assets and
refinancing risks for energy companies. At the same time, there is considerable upside
potential, with the AI-led increase in demand for electricity and equipment presenting
opportunities to commercialise new technologies or reinvigorate the supply chains and
skilled workforce for existing technologies. How this plays out for energy companies is
contingent not only on their exposure but also on company-specific strategies and
approaches to risk mitigation.

How are companies responding to increased AI demand growth?
Large gas turbine manufacturers are expanding capacity with caution
Gas turbine manufacturers are preparing to expand manufacturing capacity over the next
several years in response to rising demand (Table 7.1). Recent corporate announcements by
manufacturers indicate a pivot towards the US market, due in part to the rapid expansion of
data centres there, but also due to overall increases in domestic electricity demand following
decades of stagnation (Siemens Energy, 2026). However, because this expansion follows a
prolonged period of weak order intake, most companies appear to be taking a measured
approach, focusing on reducing lead times and scaling output within existing facilities rather
than pursuing aggressive greenfield growth. Only small turbine manufacturers with limited
existing manufacturing capacity have signalled more ambitious plans.

This capital discipline is also supported by a diverse set of long-term revenue drivers linked
to electrification. For example, Siemens Energy has increased transformer manufacturing
capacity by 20%, and the company is reporting an order backlog of EUR 42 billion for its grid
technologies (Siemens Energy, 2025b). The electrification segment of GE Vernova similarly
recorded year-on-year revenue growth of 25% and a 30% increase in its order backlog
(GE Vernova, 2025). Improved margins in the turbine segment may even create positive
spillovers for these adjacent business lines, where investment needs are accelerating.
New rate structures also aim to share infrastructure costs and risks
Large investments are needed to provide grid connections for data centres and meet their
power demand. As noted above, uncertainty in the data centre demand outlook remains
high, with energy investments ranging from USD 0.5 trillion to USD 1 trillion across different
IEA cases. This potentially presents a risk to utilities if investments in power and grid capacity
are made to meet demand that later falls short of expectations. At the same time, AI

companies have an interest in ensuring that power investments do take place to meet their
demand. Utilities, technology companies and regulators are therefore pursuing innovative
tariff models to share costs and mitigate risks.
These include collateral postings for new data centre connection requests in case a planned
data centre is not built, stated capacity ramp periods, minimum billing demand
commitments over periods of up to 20 years and early exit fees for data centre closures
(Credit Sights, 2026). In the United States, regulators and/or utilities across 24 different
states have approved or proposed some combination of these measures, covering many data
centre hotspots (Credit Sights, 2026 and Goldman Sachs, 2026). In tandem, hyperscalers such
as Microsoft have committed to covering the costs of adding and using electricity
infrastructure for their data centres (Microsoft, 2026). Several other hyperscalers have
signed a federal government-led pledge to prevent infrastructure costs from being passed
on to US households (White House, 2026).
There are some exceptions where data centre load growth is high and protections have not
been introduced, although data centre operators can still develop mechanisms to actively
support and co-fund large grid investment in these jurisdictions. Moreover, even in locations
where protections have been introduced, they may not cover all fixed costs arising from new
large-load connections, including those that occurred before new policies took effect.
Protections such as minimum billable demand and long-term contracts are conducive, but
full fixed-cost recovery also depends on the tariff level and on whether network charges are
shallow or deep.
Overall, recent measures should be effective in transferring some of the financial burden
away from utilities, thereby reducing the downside risks for them. However, the extent to
which consumers will be protected is less clear. To date, there are few examples of US states
legislating full cost recovery by data centre operators (Goldman Sachs, 2026). For instance,
proposed legislation in the US state of Georgia to explicitly ban electricity investment costs
for data centres from being passed onto consumers was abandoned in favour of more
flexible protections (Georgia General Assembly, 2026). More broadly, as discussed later in
this report, the impact of data centres on electricity prices is contingent on several other
factors. This means that protections for utilities still leave the door open to some form of
cross-subsidisation in either direction, i.e. other ratepayers subsidising data centre costs, or
data centre operators subsidising electricity costs for other ratepayers.
The success of smaller start-ups may be more contingent on the data centre build-out
Operators of existing nuclear power plants have been major beneficiaries of corporate
power-purchase agreements (PPAs) from AI-related companies, which amounted to 7.1 GW
from 2024 through the first quarter of 2026. A key quality of these PPAs is that most have
received a positive final investment decision and represent a firm commitment to contract,
restart, upgrade or extend the lifetime of existing generators. The details of these
agreements are not always known, but off-takers are usually bound to their terms for up to
25 years, giving generators confidence to make new investments where necessary.

Powering data centres

In contrast, the 45 GW of new small modular reactor (SMR) capacity contracted by
AI‑focused tech companies has largely taken the form of less formal off‑take arrangements.
These off-take agreements are much larger than firm PPAs for SMRs and, due to the
immaturity of the technology, are not yet backed by firm financing commitments (Credit
Sights, 2026). Consequently, any pullback from AI-related companies would be a serious
setback. Continued demand growth from data centres for low-emissions, baseload power
would provide a considerable boost to the commercialisation of these technologies. The
same could also be true for next-generation geothermal, which has likewise benefited from
the backing of large technology companies and the signing of several off-take agreements,
with the first commercial project set to start supplying electricity as soon as 2026 or 2027
(Fervo Energy, 2023).
In either case, public support and strategic public capital will play an important role in
reducing market risks for these early-stage projects while also helping to catalyse private
capital.

Key takeaways
Powering data centres will require cumulative investment of between USD 0.5 trillion and
USD 1 trillion through to 2030. While large in absolute terms, this remains relatively small
compared with overall investment in the energy sector, which is projected to be around
USD 18 trillion from 2026 to 2030. Similarly, data centre electricity consumption is projected

to rise from around 1.7% of electricity demand in 2025 to around 3% by 2030. For these
reasons, the data centre boom is not showing up as unusual growth in market capitalisation
at the level of the energy sector as a whole.
On the other hand, there are pockets of the energy sector where prospects do seem to be
driven, at least in part, by the growth of data centres. These include gas turbine and grid
equipment manufacturers, nuclear companies, some start-ups in fields such as fuel cells, and
utilities in major data centre hotspots, although the empirical evidence of a link is somewhat
weaker in the last case. In these areas, outcomes will depend not only on the outlook for
data centre demand but also on the investment strategies adopted by companies and on
regulatory measures to share risks, for example in the case of electricity tariffs. The data
centre boom is providing significant impetus to a number of energy start-ups, but public
support will also be required to ensure that they reach their full potential.

Are data centres raising electricity prices?
Wholesale and retail electricity prices have risen sharply across many major economies in
recent years following the post-Covid-19 inflation spike and the global energy crisis of 2022.
Between January 2019 and December 2025, residential electricity prices increased faster
than headline inflation in markets such as the European Union, Korea, the United Kingdom
and the United States. Although electricity prices eased somewhat from 2023 onwards as
gas markets stabilised, they remain elevated relative to pre-crisis averages and continue to
be exposed to market volatility in many markets, keeping affordability in focus.

8.1 Surging data centre growth in some regions presents a unique challenge
In recent years, electricity demand from data centres has grown rapidly in some regions and
is projected to continue rising, raising questions about how this growth could affect
electricity prices.
Electricity demand growth from data centres affects power markets through several
interrelated mechanisms. The challenge stems not only from the scale of demand but also
from the speed of growth, which can outpace infrastructure planning and execution cycles.
Understanding how these mechanisms operate, and how their effects vary in different
markets, is essential to assessing both the risks and options for mitigation. Analysis of this

issue needs to distinguish between short-term and long-term effects, and between effects in
systems with spare capacity and those with tighter demand-supply balances.
Short-term effects
In the near term, rapid growth in large and typically inflexible electricity loads, such as data
centres, can increase reliance on higher-cost generation units that would otherwise run less
frequently, putting upward pressure on wholesale prices. Where data centres cluster in
specific locations, they can increase costs arising from transmission congestion. Fast-growing
data centre clusters can also prompt the short-term procurement of emergency reserve
generation to maintain adequacy.
By contrast, in systems with more relaxed balances of demand and supply, additional
demand can improve the utilisation of existing assets and spread fixed costs over a larger
customer base, lowering per-unit network and fixed-cost charges and, in some cases, even
exerting downward pressure on per-unit system costs. These effects tend to be strongest in
large, well-interconnected systems with diversified loads and supply, where incremental
demand can be absorbed without triggering major network upgrades or new capacity
requirements.

Across selected markets, changes in retail electricity prices from 2019 to 2024 show only a
weak relationship with changes in electricity demand (Figure 8.2). In the European Union,
price increases have frequently occurred in the context of flat or declining demand, which
may reflect demand destruction as a response to elevated prices in recent years. In the
United States, electricity prices were less affected by the 2022 energy crisis, and states with
greater load growth generally did not see higher price increases, consistent with earlier
empirical findings (Wiser et al., 2025). The analysis shown in Figure 8.2 reflects national or
state-level averages and may therefore mask localised price effects in areas with
concentrated load growth. Ultimately, the data highlight that there is no simple, one-way
relationship between load growth and electricity prices.
Longer-term effects
Beyond the near-term effects, a core challenge is that data centres are expanding on
timelines far shorter than those of the power system. New data centre facilities can be
deployed in one to two years, while adding major transmission infrastructure or new
dispatchable generation capacity typically takes much longer. This mismatch means that
sustained, concentrated demand growth can quickly overtake existing capacity, boosting
investment needs for the energy system over the longer term.
Expectations of rapidly growing peak loads are already affecting capacity markets by
tightening forward-looking capacity adequacy assessments. This was visible in recent
auctions in the PJM8 Interconnection, which covers Virginia’s “Data Centre Alley”, where
clearing prices reached the regulatory price cap in successive rounds. The independent
market monitor, Monitoring Analytics, identified projected large data centre load additions
as a key contributing factor (Monitoring Analytics, 2025).
Capacity prices in PJM have been affected by supply side and administrative issues, such as
delays from long interconnection queues and changes in resource accreditation that lowered
capacity credits for parts of the gas fleet. Recent changes to PJM’s capacity market have also
drawn criticism. Monitoring Analytics found that the new design was implemented before it
had been fully tested and that market outcomes are overly sensitive to modelling
assumptions, leading to unstable price signals. In response, PJM has adopted interim
measures, including tighter participation requirements across resource types, revisions to

Uncertainty around the realisation of the load forecasts remains a key risk. PJM load
forecasts may include duplicative or speculative requests from data centre developers
pursuing multiple siting options. Recent updates show that near-term load projections for
2026 are lower than in the previous year’s forecast, even as long-term projections continue
to rise.

Over the long term, sustained growth in data centre electricity demand can reshape power
systems by raising peak loads and increasing the need for new generation capacity and
network infrastructure. However, even if more investment is needed to maintain system
adequacy, whether this leads to an increase in the per-unit cost of electricity depends on a
range of factors.

What can Texas forward prices tell us about the effect of data
centres on electricity prices?
Forward electricity prices are often used to gauge expectations about future market
conditions. By reflecting the price agreed today for power delivered in the future, they
incorporate market views on the overall balance between supply and demand, including
factors such as fuel prices, capacity additions, policy changes and demand growth.
Expectations about the expansion of data centres are only one of many drivers that may
influence forward price curves. In principle, if data centre growth were expected to
significantly tighten system balances or raise costs, this could be reflected in higher
forward prices. However, forward prices also reflect risk premia, hedging dynamics and
declining liquidity at longer horizons, which means they imperfectly capture the
underlying fundamentals.

The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) offers an interesting case study in this
regard. First, the state is a hotspot for data centre growth (Box 1.2). Second, ERCOT does
not have a capacity market, so the energy-only market provides the only incentive for
investment, with scarcity pricing used to signal tight conditions. A relatively flat forward
curve suggests that market participants currently anticipate sufficient supply to meet
rising demand, including from data centres, without sustained price pressure (Figure 8.4).
Figure 8.4 ⊳

forward prices are relatively flat through to 2030
Note: The forward prices reflect market expectations as of 5 March 2026 and may change as market
conditions evolve.

Several factors may help explain this. First, supply growth expectations remain strong,
with rapid additions of solar, wind and battery storage continuing to expand capacity.
Second, a large share of announced data centre demand remains uncertain, as
interconnection queues for large loads often overstate the amount of demand that
ultimately materialises. Third, fuel price assumptions, particularly for natural gas, which
frequently sets the marginal price, continue to play a dominant role in shaping forward
electricity prices. Finally, regulatory developments, including proposed state measures
to better manage large-load connections, such as in Senate Bill 6, may also influence
expectations about how quickly data centre demand will translate into realised system
load.
Taken together, a relatively flat forward curve should therefore not be interpreted as
evidence that data centre growth will have no impact on electricity prices, but rather as
a reflection of current expectations that supply will keep pace with demand in ERCOT.

8.2
Understanding what drives system costs
To maintain electricity security, power systems have traditionally been designed to meet
periods of peak demand, even if this results in the underutilisation of assets at other times.
As a result, both generation capacity and transmission and distribution networks are
designed to ensure adequacy during relatively short windows of time. Electricity systems are
also highly capital intensive, with the capital recovery costs of generators and networks
usually accounting for around 40-60% of total system costs. Since these costs are relatively
insensitive to short-term variations in output, the extent to which assets are utilised over
time is a key determinant of average electricity costs.
The ratio of average system demand to peak system demand, also called the system load
factor, is a key indicator of asset utilisation and cost efficiency. Systems with low load factors,
characterised by high peak demand relative to average load, must maintain large amounts
of expensive, often idle generation and network equipment. Conversely, systems with higher
load factors allow fixed costs to be spread over a larger volume of electricity consumption,
improving asset utilisation and reducing average per-unit costs.
While the system load factor is a useful indicator of asset utilisation, it is not a fixed
characteristic of electricity systems. It reflects the aggregation of demand profiles across
different end-use sectors and can be influenced by technologies such as battery storage and
mechanisms such as demand response. Industrial loads tend to be relatively stable over time
and therefore contribute to higher system load factors, while the reverse is typically true of
residential loads. A crucial question in assessing the impact of data centres on system costs
over the longer term is whether data centre loads will raise or lower system load factors in
affected regions. If data centre loads improve the utilisation of generation and network
assets over time, they could contribute to lower average costs. If they instead increase peak
demand and reduce system load factors, they risk increasing system costs by intensifying the
need for additional, rarely utilised capacity.
To understand how these factors play out in the case of data centres, it is important to
distinguish between the load factor of data centres and the capacity utilisation rate. The first
refers to the ratio of average load to peak load. The second refers to the ratio of average
load to nameplate capacity.
Data centres typically have relatively high load factors, in the order of 75-90%. This
characteristic can support the efficient utilisation of generation and network assets over
time. However, higher load factors do not automatically imply lower price pressures, as a
data centre with a high load factor may still contribute significantly to peak demand,
tightening capacity margins and increasing price pressures during peak periods.
At the same time, data centres often have lower capacity utilisation rates. This is not unique
to data centres and can also occur with other large industrial loads or residential loads.
However, a number of factors make this issue particularly relevant to data centres. Unlike
large industrial facilities, they are modular. This means computing equipment is installed
progressively, leading to a slow ramp-up of demand and low initial utilisation of grid

connections. Combined with uncertainty about future demand, and competition for scarce
capacity, this encourages operators to over-contract capacity. The resulting underutilisation
of available grid connections can lead to the oversizing of networks and reserve
infrastructure, reducing capital efficiency. In congested systems, the over-contracting of grid
capacity can also impose an opportunity cost by blocking capacity that could otherwise serve
other loads.
The key point here is that, while data centres may have high load factors, which in theory
support affordability by promoting efficient capital utilisation, they often have lower capacity
utilisation rates, which may work in the opposite direction. Importantly, there is scope for
policy makers to intervene by supporting more efficient integration of data centres into the
grid.

8.3
Policy and technology levers offer scope to mitigate price impacts
Overall, rising electricity demand from data centres poses a growing challenge for power
systems and energy affordability, but the scale of the impact depends on system conditions,
the pace and location of growth, regulatory frameworks and market design, leaving policy
makers and data centre developers with significant scope to shape outcomes.
For example, improving visibility on the location, scale and timing of data centre
developments can reduce system costs by avoiding premature or unnecessary investment
for power loads that may not ultimately materialise. Early co-ordination between
developers, system operators and regulators – combined with stronger financial
requirements for new large loads, “use it or lose it” measures for reserved grid capacity and
better data transparency around load ramps for data centres – could help align network and
capacity planning with the actual outlook for grid demand from data centres.
Policy and planning also shape where new data centre demand materialises and how local
system impacts are managed. In highly constrained areas, temporary caps or moratoria on
new connections, as seen in Singapore, can safeguard reliability and prevent inefficient
investment. In contrast, in less constrained areas, clearer incentives for data centres to locate
where spare grid capacity is available, together with faster permitting, can guide
development more efficiently.
Operational flexibility could be another effective lever for mitigating system and price
impacts. Data centres can provide flexibility by shifting non-urgent workloads over time
(Box 8.2), reallocating computing tasks across multiple locations, modulating cooling
demand, or using onsite energy storage or generation to manage peak grid demand.
Emerging initiatives such as demand response programmes, dynamic contracts and
accelerated grid access for non-firm connection agreements could reduce the need for
additional reserves, network updates and peaking capacity, thereby mitigating both system-
wide costs and local network stress.
Efficiency improvements in servers, cooling systems and overall power usage effectiveness
can reduce the growth of electricity demand per unit of digital output. While efficiency gains
cannot offset rapid expansion in data centre activity, they can slow demand growth and delay
the need for new generation and network investment.
Expanding electricity supply and grid infrastructure is the most direct way to mitigate price
and adequacy pressures arising from rising data centre demand. This can include accelerating
new generation, co-locating data centres with new supply and introducing capacity
remuneration mechanisms to bring forward additional capacity, including rapidly deployable
options such as solar PV paired with battery storage. Optimising existing grid infrastructure
utilisation through grid-enhancing technologies can also delay or reduce the need for
additional network upgrades. In Ireland, for example, new large loads are increasingly
required to co-locate with generation capacity, ensuring that demand growth is matched by
additional supply and reducing transmission costs. The effectiveness of this lever depends
on permitting timelines, grid access and whether new supply is delivered in locations where

Powering data centres

demand growth is occurring. At the EU level, recent initiatives, such as the European Grids
Package, aim to address these constraints by strengthening network planning and
connection processes (European Commission, 2025b).
Policy makers should also ensure that co-location agreements, onsite generation or direct
supply contracts do not result in the shifting of costs to other electricity consumers. For
example, when a data centre co-locates with an existing plant and diverts its output, other
consumers may lose access to that generation, potentially pushing up electricity prices.
Similarly, if data centres install onsite generation and reduce their draw from the network,
other consumers may face higher per-unit infrastructure costs, raising equity and
affordability concerns.
Box 8.2 ⊳
Incentivising more flexible data centres
More flexible data centre loads could reduce the need for costly network and generation
capacity upgrades and therefore help limit the impact of data centre loads on system
costs and prices. Our analysis finds that if data centre demand is flexible for between
0.1-1% of the hours in a year, there is enough room in current electricity systems to
integrate all new data centre capacity projected to come online through to 2035 (IEA,
2025a).
There are three kinds of data centre flexibility. First, onsite power assets such as batteries
or gas turbines can be used to reduce data centre loads at times of peak demand. Second,
auxiliary power consumption, notably for cooling, can be reduced. Third, data centre
operations (also known as workloads) could be re-routed geographically or deferred in
time to lower electricity consumption during periods of high grid stress. However,
numerous challenges must be overcome to make data centre operations more flexible,
particularly for the third option. These include the following:

Organisational challenges: Some data centre operators, notably co-location
providers, may not have visibility over the workloads taking place inside the data
centre, as these are scheduled and executed by the actors that lease the facility from
the operator. This means the operator may not know which workloads could be
rescheduled, and which are time-sensitive and cannot be deferred.

Contractual challenges: Data centre operators may have service agreements with
their customers that involve strict penalties for service interruptions. Unless
frameworks are robust and incentives are sufficient, operators may be reluctant to
take on the added risk of providing load flexibility in case it leads to a breach of their
service obligations.

Financial challenges: Electricity costs typically represent a small share of the total
costs of a data centre, which are dominated by the capital costs of IT hardware.
There is therefore a strong incentive for data centre customers to maximise IT
hardware utilisation, as reduction in utilisation can have high opportunity costs.
IEA. CC BY 4.0.

76
International Energy Agency | Key questions on energy and AI

Several initiatives and pilot projects are under way to test approaches for making data
centres more flexible. Given that time to market is a key consideration, incentives related
to faster grid connections are likely to be more attractive than payments for demand
response. Frameworks that determine the parameters for curtailment, such as duration
and the applicable conditions, could help data centre operators plan more effectively.
Improving the exchange of information, including labelling schemes for workloads that
define time sensitivity and agreed parameters for deferring workloads, would help
achieve greater standardisation and visibility across different parts of the value chain.
Allocating grid costs to ensure fairness
Grid cost allocation, or the method by which the costs associated with investing in, operating
and maintaining electrical grids are distributed among various users or customer groups, has
become a central policy issue as large new electricity users, including data centres, raise
questions about fairness. In some regions, concerns have emerged that data centres may not
be paying their full share of the infrastructure required to support them, resulting in
cross-subsidisation by other consumers. The process of grid cost allocation is designed to
fairly apportion costs based on factors such as usage, capacity and connection type. While
tensions among stakeholders on this topic are not new, the pace and scale of recent data
centre load growth have brought them into sharper focus.
Traditionally, grid costs are recovered primarily through regulated network charges
embedded in retail tariffs. These charges are typically structured as a combination of
volumetric (per kilowatt-hour) and capacity-related (per kilowatt) components, often with
time-of-use differentiation. In addition, new users usually face one-time connection charges.
These may be shallow, covering only the direct connection to the grid, or deep, requiring the
user to fund upstream network reinforcements triggered by their connection.
There are large variations across markets in how these charges are applied, as well as in how
large load additions are treated (Table 8.1). Globally, large new loads such as data centres
are generally integrated into existing grid tariff frameworks rather than being subject to
dedicated tariff classes. However, there are exceptions. In the United States, several utilities
have introduced, or are introducing, data centre-specific or large load-specific rate classes.
One example is Virginia, where regulators have approved a new rate class for large loads
over 25 MW and with load factors over 75%, which will take effect from January 2027. This
fee includes minimum demand charge provisions, exit fees and long-term commitment
requirements (Virginia State Corporation Commission, 2025). Another example is in Canada,
where Hydro-Québec, which manages the region’s electricity supply and distribution, is
proposing a new rate for data centres above 5 MW that is approximately double what large
consumers currently pay (Hydro-Québec, 2026).
Data centres are increasingly under scrutiny in this context. Tensions between ensuring that
data centres pay their fair share of grid costs and maintaining their global competitiveness
are at the heart of today’s policy debate. Regulators are increasingly requiring large new

loads to contribute more directly to grid costs, for example through upfront connection fees
or additional conditions attached to system access. Several large technology companies have
recently signed a pledge with the US federal government (White House, 2026) to take
measures to limit the impact of data centre demand on electricity prices for other
consumers. Proposed measures include covering network upgrade costs or procuring
additional generation capacity. While voluntary and non-binding, this pledge shows that the
topic is high on the policy agenda.

Key takeaways
The electricity price implications of data centre growth are highly context-specific and
depend on factors such as the pace, location and system conditions under which new
demand emerges, as well as on market design and regulatory frameworks. When large loads
connect rapidly in constrained markets, they can place upward pressure on electricity prices.
By contrast, when demand growth is anticipated and aligned with timely investment,
operational flexibility and clear cost allocation, price impacts can be limited. Policy and
planning choices by both data centre developers and system planners will therefore be
central in determining whether data centre expansion translates into affordability pressures
or is integrated efficiently into power systems.

Impact of AI on energy
9
How can AI enhance energy security and sustainability
in energy, and what are the barriers to wider adoption?
AI is being deployed commercially in the energy sector for a range of objectives, including
making energy systems more secure, competitive and sustainable. As the capabilities of AI
systems have increased, so too have the opportunities. AI is now being used not only to
process large datasets and predict what will happen but also to help enable real-time
decision-making in the energy sector, such as by managing batteries and improving grid
stability.
These improvements come at a time when the energy sector is facing new challenges.
Concerns about energy security and supply chain resilience are high on the political agenda,
as are energy affordability and industrial competitiveness. At the same time, the energy
system is becoming more complex and dynamic. Electricity is increasingly used in energy
consumption, and variable renewable sources are playing a bigger role in power generation.
Batteries are also being rapidly installed to provide greater flexibility to both the grid and
local users. Additionally, countries are working to achieve long-term climate, energy
transition, efficiency and sustainability targets. While AI can contribute to these goals, there
is still a lack of understanding of its full potential and the barriers to its wider use in the
energy sector.
9.1
The role of AI in enhancing energy security and sustainability
As geopolitical and supply chain risks mount, the role of AI in enhancing energy security,
reliability, resilience and demand response has come into focus. AI is also being deployed to
integrate renewables, enhance efficiency and accelerate innovation in new energy
technologies. The IEA published real-world case studies of AI applications in the energy
sector in its Energy and AI Observatory, as well as in a joint publication with India’s Ministry
of Electronics and Information Technology for the AI Impact Summit 2026. These use cases,
many of which have been commercially deployed, illustrate the impact that AI is already
having in the energy sector. Examples of these applications include:

Reliability and resilience: AI-powered predictive maintenance reduces downtime in
critical energy systems by enabling proactive interventions, unlike traditional schedule-
based maintenance, which can result in unexpected failures and emergency repairs. In
the United States, AI tools now monitor more than 10 000 transformers and
22 000 circuit breakers, significantly reducing outages (C3.ai, n.d.).
IEA. CC BY 4.0.

Impact of AI on energy
79


Demand response: AI platforms are being deployed to help reduce electricity demand
during periods of grid stress, thereby improving reliability at the system level. AI-enabled
platforms can automate demand response. For example, AI has been deployed to
automatically manage heating, ventilation and air conditioning devices based on real-
time market conditions among more than 1.5 million devices in 250 000 buildings in
eight European countries. This approach has unlocked 2 GW of demand response (IEA,
2025f).

Integration of variable renewable energy: AI-enhanced weather forecasting is
supporting the integration of variable renewables into grids and minimising curtailment.
AI is also being deployed to automate the management of complex energy systems
involving batteries and distributed solar resources. For example, in Chile, the use of an
AI-enabled forecasting model that is up to 15% more accurate than previous industry
standards has led to more effective grid management, greater integration of wind
energy and reduced curtailment (IEA, 2025g). In India, an AI-enabled plant-specific solar
forecasting platform has helped solar generators reduce regulatory penalties arising
from inaccurate output forecasts (IEA, 2026a).

Energy efficiency and cost reductions: AI solutions are increasingly being used to
improve energy consumption in industry and buildings. In Brazil, for example, an AI tool
used in iron and steel production draws on blast furnace data to forecast thermal
conditions, enabling better decisions that lower energy and material use, as well as
emissions per tonne of iron (IEA, 2026b).

Energy innovation: AI can help accelerate parts of the innovation pipeline, which in turn
can help make energy systems more secure and sustainable. For example, at a
laboratory in the United States, AI helped accelerate the screening process for potential
battery materials, predicting material properties 1 500 times faster than traditional
density functional theory calculations. What would have typically required years of high-
performance computing calculations and laboratory experimentation was reduced to
just a few days using AI. One of the predicted candidates showed the potential to reduce
lithium requirements in batteries by approximately 70% (IEA, 2025h). AI is also being
used to support the development of nuclear fusion technologies (IRFM, 2025).
IEA analysis estimates that if existing AI applications in energy end-use sectors were scaled
up to the sectoral level, they could unlock energy savings to the tune of 13.5 EJ by 2035,
equivalent to Indonesia’s annual energy demand today. Doing so, however, would require
overcoming the various barriers that currently impede the deployment of AI at the sectoral
level.

solutions that might emerge in the future. A detailed discussion of this approach is available in IEA (2025a).
Box 9.1 ⊳
What types of AI are used in innovation and energy sector
optimisation?
Popular AI models used for generative tasks such as writing a few paragraphs or
rendering an image are often called frontier models. These models are trained on vast
databases of text, audio, videos and images. They are based on AI approaches such as
deep learning. These models typically require large quantities of electricity for training
and inference and are the main drivers of electricity consumption growth from data
centres today.
In contrast, domain-specific models, such as those used in energy sector optimisation
and scientific domains such as biology or engineering, are often smaller and trained on
specific data. These models are deployed in scientific research, industrial design and the
optimisation of complex economic systems such as factories or power grids. Their energy
footprint is typically many orders of magnitude lower than that of frontier AI models. For
example, the training of biological AI models requires only a small fraction of the compute
used in frontier large language model training runs (Figure 9.2).

Today, many of the commercially available solutions in the energy sector still rely on
classical AI approaches. 9 For example, several commercially available AI-led building
energy management solutions leverage predictive analytics and automated heating,
ventilation and air conditioning control through machine learning. However, AI solutions
in the energy sector are increasingly benefiting from AI approaches such as neural
networks and deep learning. For example, hyperlocal weather forecasting models that
enable the integration of variable renewable energy into the grid may use a mixture of
classical machine learning alongside deep learning.

and less computationally intensive than frontier generative AI models
Note: FLOPS = floating-point operations per second.
Sources: IEA analysis based on Epoch AI (2026a and 2026b).
While there are differences in training data, model size and energy consumption across
such models, many innovations spill over between consumer-facing generative models
and scientific models. For example, diffusion-based image generation models are finding
applications in object recognition and robotics, accelerating progress in physical AI
systems (see section 10). Core architectural innovations from generative AI, such as
transformers, have also brought critical improvements to domains such as materials
science by improving the prediction of material properties from material composition.
Finally, frontier AI models, such as large language models, are also increasingly being
integrated into scientific and energy sector workflows, helping researchers and system
operators interact with large amounts of structured and unstructured data and text.

9.2
Barriers to scaling up AI use in the energy sector
While the uptake of AI solutions in the energy sector is increasing, most successes so far have
been individual case studies rather than system-wide deployments. Further scaling up of AI
use requires overcoming barriers such as limited training data, concerns over cybersecurity
and data privacy, insufficient policy support, the limited digitalisation of energy equipment
and a shortage of AI-related skills in the energy sector.
Data availability, accessibility and quality
The adoption of AI in energy, and specifically within the electricity sector, is limited by data
that are often fragmented, low-quality and inaccessible. Critical information on demand
patterns, grid performance, outages and asset health is dispersed across legacy systems and
organisational silos, with limited data sharing between public and private actors. Concerns
over cybersecurity are often a contributing factor. Notably, grid operators and utilities face
regulatory obligations concerning the security of operational technology, which limit data
sharing and AI model deployment in real-time control systems.
Data across the energy value chain also lacks standardisation, making aggregation and
interoperability for AI training difficult. Regulatory constraints and the absence of widely
adopted open standards restrict the creation of clean, integrated datasets. Together, these
factors form a structural bottleneck that prevents the wider deployment of AI for grid
balancing, predictive maintenance, demand forecasting, fault detection and renewables
integration, all of which would support broader energy goals.
In recent years, regulations have advanced to support new electricity data-sharing
frameworks. These frameworks are increasingly being formalised, but they vary in scope and
ambition. The European Union mandates smart metering, free access to consumption data
via standardised interfaces, cross-border interoperability and AI-oriented energy data
initiatives.
Policy, regulation and AI ambition
Policies and regulations designed to support data availability, interoperability and system
modernisation can help enable the adoption of AI in the energy sector. For instance, energy
efficiency regulations and mandates can incentivise energy consumers to pursue innovative
approaches involving AI to make energy use more efficient across the buildings, industry and
transport sectors. Frameworks such as EU energy efficiency reporting requirements create
structured datasets on energy use that support AI model development, while in the
United States, AI adoption in the energy sector is incentivised through federal initiatives that
frame grid modernisation as essential to AI competitiveness, with the Department of Energy
explicitly promoting AI for grid planning, permitting, operations and resilience (U.S. DOE,
2024).
Regulatory incentive structures in many electricity markets can also act as a barrier to the
adoption of AI solutions in the energy sector. In many jurisdictions, regulated utilities earn

an approved rate of return on capital expenditure. This incentivises utilities to prioritise
physical, asset-heavy investments over AI and software-based solutions, even where the
latter could deliver comparable or lower-cost system benefits.
The central policy challenge is to ensure that AI governance, data policies, energy efficiency
regulation, grid rules and financial incentives evolve in a co-ordinated way so that data
mandates and digital standards reinforce one another and accelerate AI deployment at scale.
Digitalisation
AI models need high-quality and abundant data on which to train. Digitally connected devices
and equipment are key enablers of the generation of such data. However, in the energy
sector, the rollout of digitally connected devices, equipment, infrastructure, and diagnostic
and monitoring tools has been uneven.
In buildings, smart meters, for example, can provide a valuable source of training data for
use in AI applications. While smart metering for electricity is growing, accounting for an
estimated 43% of all meters globally, metering for gas networks lags behind. Estimates
indicate that smart gas meters account for between 10% and 15% of the total.

For cars, embedded telematic units are becoming more popular.10 Estimates place the stock
of digitally connected cars at over a quarter of the global fleet. The eCall mandate in the
European Union, the European Free Trade Association and the United Kingdom has
accelerated the adoption of on-board car diagnostics, and virtually all leading carmakers
today have launched mass-market services for car diagnostics. This stands to further improve
the quality and size of datasets available for car operations and maintenance diagnostics,
which could further the applications of AI in transport, a sector which accounts for around
20% of global energy consumption.
Skills
Energy firms have identified the lack of digital skills as the single largest barrier preventing
the greater adoption of AI-led optimisation. Compared with other industries, the energy
sector lags behind in developing digital capabilities among its workforce. From 2018 to 2024,
the proportion of AI professionals within utilities, oil, gas and mining was, on average, 40%
lower than in industries such as education, financial services, technology, information and
media (IEA, 2025i).

Several energy companies today rely on the consulting services of specialised AI companies
to identify AI tools that can be used in their operations and help implement them. However,
this might pose its own challenges, as specialised AI companies often lack knowledge of
energy markets, regulation and other sector-specific factors. An alternative is to develop
internal skills and upskill existing employees, although this approach also presents
challenges, as AI is a fast-moving field that requires advanced and specialised technical
expertise.
9.3
Key takeaways
To scale AI across the energy sector in ways that enhance energy security, boost system
affordability and efficiency, and advance countries’ sustainability goals, a unified approach
to policy, regulation and market incentives is essential. Steps such as making data more
accessible and interoperable, accelerating the digitalisation of energy assets, investing in
workforce skills and developing policies to support AI applications are crucial. Without these
conditions in place, AI use in the energy sector is likely to remain limited and restricted to
small-scale pilot initiatives.
At the same time, the potential of AI applications needs to be kept in perspective. Near-term
efficiency savings potential of around 13.5 EJ by 2035 represents substantial gains, but they
are still small in the context of total energy consumption of around 450 EJ today. While AI is
an important tool for achieving energy sector goals, it cannot eliminate the need for more
traditional policies and approaches to improve efficiency, accelerate the adoption of new
technologies, and advance affordability and sustainability.

10 What does the rise of physical AI and robotics mean for
innovation and competitiveness in the energy sector?
Remarkable developments in AI software in recent years are beginning to translate into
outcomes for physical AI systems that are designed to interact with the real world. Physical
AI is embodied in hardware such as industrial robotic arms, robots used in warehouses,
drones and autonomous vehicles. The rise of physical AI has implications for the energy
sector, as it supports the rise of self-driving cars, can optimise industrial processes and has
the potential to transform the production of key energy technologies, particularly solar PV
and batteries, which are produced through mass manufacturing. This section explores the
drivers behind growing interest in physical AI, historical and emerging trends in process
automation and the growing potential of robots, along with possible consequences for the
industrial and energy sectors.
10.1 How is physical AI evolving?
Several trends in AI and hardware are aligning to generate growing financial and scientific
interest in the next generation of automation and robotics tools. These include:

Falling costs for hardware and increasing capabilities of on-device computation. Costs
for critical components such as motors and sensors have fallen sharply, notably
following the entry of Chinese manufacturers. Computational hardware, such as tensor
processing units and neural processing units, is becoming increasingly available and
efficient and is well suited for use in edge computing (i.e. computation performed on
devices or on nearby servers). This is important for applications in which latency
matters, such as autonomous driving. Software improvements have also enabled the
use of smaller models that can run directly on devices.

Spillovers from generative AI that boost performance. Innovations in generative AI are
now enabling physical autonomous systems to understand the “semantics”, or the
meaning and logic, of the world they operate in. For example, an autonomous vehicle
can use semantic understanding to predict the behaviour of others more effectively in
novel situations (for example, a football rolling onto the street might be followed by a
child running after it). Similarly, semantic understanding can be used to give high-level
instructions to autonomous systems in natural language, without the need for these
instructions to be encoded in a more detailed programming language.

Improved modelling of physics and integration of video, simulated and real-world
data. The development of world foundation models,11 trained on video, simulated and
physical data, is enabling autonomous systems to learn the laws of physics more
intuitively. Better integration of simulated and video data with real-world data enables

11 World foundation models are models designed to understand, simulate and predict the physical world. They
aim to be generalisable across a range of physical environments by understanding the laws of physics and
model the behaviour of agents (humans, animals or other autonomous systems) in the real world.

autonomous systems to be trained rapidly in simulated environments and then fine-
tuned in the real world.
The combined effects of these developments can have important impacts on a range of
industries. The automation of industrial processes, which are complex systems that cannot
be represented by simple models, is becoming increasingly sophisticated, with the potential
for high returns for early adopters that can make them more competitive. Robots are also
attracting significant attention from investors and could transform several other industries,
though the outlook for their deployment remains uncertain. Growing interest in this field can
be seen in the rise of new datasets for AI training for robotics and the increase in venture
capital in physical AI (Figure 10.1).

10.2 Can physical AI drive competitiveness by improving process
automation?
For decades, the use of state-of-the-art computational technology to automate production
processes has played a key role in maintaining industrial competitiveness. Early automation
processes were based on simple actuators whose responses were defined in prescriptive
ways in response to a small amount of external data. Over time, greater computational and
hardware capabilities have enabled many industries to introduce more sophisticated
predictive automation, including through early AI techniques like machine learning. This has

enabled a more advanced, predictive style of process automation in which multiple
processes interact and learn from previous events.
These existing uses of AI have already demonstrated incremental opportunities for reducing
energy demand, thereby improving industrial competitiveness. For instance, image
detection can optimise material input and output quality and reduce waste. Machine
learning applied to data collected from sensors across an industrial facility can also bring
system-wide optimisation (IEA, 2025a). These incremental improvements can reduce energy
costs by 3 to 10 percentage points in energy-intensive industries, where energy costs are an
important factor and margins tend to be low. Because of short implementation times and
payback periods, these tools offer opportunities to quickly improve competitiveness,
especially in trade-exposed industries such as steel and aluminium. The opportunities to
reduce energy costs are even greater in non-energy-intensive industries, although since
energy costs contribute less to total production costs, the impact on competitiveness is less
substantial. We estimate that total energy savings from the widespread application of AI
tools across the industry sector could deliver 8 EJ of energy savings by 2035, although
barriers remain (see section 9).
Figure 10.2 ⊳ Energy cost reduction from existing AI applications, and share of
energy in the levelised cost of production, 2024

IEA. CC BY 4.0.
AI can drive small but meaningful changes in energy costs, and these are largest for non-
energy-intensive industry, but energy accounts for a smaller share of their production costs
However, the growth of physical AI is increasingly leading to more flexible and high-
performing process automation, driven by the growth in domain-specific models.12 These

12 Domain-specific models are trained on specific tasks, in specific environments. They contrast with models
that are trained to generalise to a broader range of tasks. A domain-specific model would be one trained to
optimise heating and cooling in a specific production environment, for example, based on historical data from
the facility.

models are trained on context-specific data and often use physics-based models to improve
accuracy. By processing terabytes of data generated every hour from thousands of sensors
in industrial processes, far more than can be processed by simple systems or by onsite
engineers, such models can learn to anticipate opportunities, bottlenecks and risks.
Once established, these domain models can bring industries into a new and more adaptive
phase of automation. Tools that self-correct in real time now allow for the automation of
complex tasks that were previously impossible. For example, light industries are increasingly
electrifying heat to substitute or supplement their existing fossil fuel boilers. AI tools can
already support electrification by optimising participation in electricity markets, but domain
models mean they can integrate power market optimisation into the management of both
flexible and inflexible onsite processes and respond to unexpected events when they occur.
This adaptivity can make industries more resilient, more efficient in their use of energy,
materials and labour, and ultimately more competitive.

new approaches could enable the next wave of productivity growth
Note: Industrial energy productivity is the ratio of industrial value added to industrial energy demand, shown
here for advanced economies indexed to 1960.

technological precision and extensive material processing. For instance, about half of the

difference between the cost of producing a battery in the European Union and in China is
due to differences in production efficiency enabled by China’s higher deployment of
advanced automation techniques, which in turn lead to higher manufacturing yields (IEA,
2025j). Box 10.1 addresses China’s AI strategy in more detail.
Despite the opportunities they offer for competitiveness, the deployment of advanced
physical AI is neither straightforward nor inevitable (see section 9). Subject matter experts
are needed to coordinate model training for domain-specific models, particularly because
significant amounts of knowledge and data are not held in formats suitable for model
training. The absence of fully digitised enabling hardware, the cost of developing domain
models for individual sectors and plants, and a lack of awareness, trust and AI capability
within some subsectors can also reduce appetite for these projects.
Box 10.1 ⊳ How does China think about the role of physical AI in the energy
and manufacturing sectors?
The United States remains the leader in so-called frontier AI models, as well as in the
design of key AI hardware. However, after Chinese researchers surprised the AI world
with the release of the highly capable model DeepSeek R1, there has been increased
attention on China’s AI strategy and progress, particularly regarding its application in
manufacturing, given China’s dominance in global manufacturing.
China’s strategy can be characterised at a high level by three aspects:

A strong focus on compute efficiency but lower hardware efficiency: China’s model
developers are compute-constrained due to a lack of access to high-end chips. They
therefore focus strongly on techniques to reduce the use of compute during training
and model use. At the same time, China’s AI chips lag significantly behind cutting-
edge chips from suppliers such as NVIDIA in terms of energy efficiency (SemiAnalysis,
2025b).

A strong focus on open-source ecosystems: China’s model developers tend to
release their models as open source, enabling users to download and customise
them as needed. This can be attractive for enterprise use in the services and industry
sectors. In 2025, China’s models overtook those from developers in the
United States in terms of total downloads on open-source platforms.

A focus on AI applications across the economy: China’s national AI strategy focuses
on increasing the use of AI across the economy to improve productivity and
innovation. This can be seen in data on the primary focus of Chinese models
registered with its telecoms regulator. To this extent, China does not view the “AI
race” in terms of a race towards the best model or achieving artificial general
intelligence (Chan, 2026). Rather, its strategy aims to drive the uptake of AI models
in manufacturing, in science and innovation and across the economy more broadly.
This can also be seen in the strong venture capital numbers for start-ups focused on
physical AI in China.

10.3 Will robots be the next technology to transform the industrial and
energy sectors?
Industrial robotics and physical AI are attracting attention as a possible next frontier of AI
deployment. Although the automation of physical tasks is already widespread in industry, AI
could enable industrial robots to operate in a wider range of settings and with comparatively
less supervision. Robotic dogs, for instance, have been deployed in cement facilities to
perform routine inspections around plants in a repeatable and precise manner. Given the
opportunities businesses see to enhance competitiveness, the adoption of robotics across
the industrial and energy sectors could rise in the coming years.
Enthusiasm for robotics is reflected in increased venture capital funding for companies
focused on physical AI, as well as in the rapid acceleration in the number of patents filed at
the intersection of robotics and AI over the past decade (with a particular spike noted in
2024, the most recent full year for which data are available). However, this enthusiasm is not
necessarily replicated in installations of industrial robots, which have stayed relatively stable.
China is the largest market both for producing and deploying industrial robots. More than
half of the 550 000 industrial robots installed in 2024 were in China, the majority of which
were manufactured domestically. The economic conditions that gave rise to the mass
manufacturing of energy technologies such as solar PV and electric vehicles position China
well for a similar expansion into modular robot technologies. Beyond manufacturing robots,
China is a leading supplier of robot parts, particularly actuators, which convert electrical

The need for large upfront investments could act as a brake on the deployment of complex
robots across the industrial and energy sectors, and beyond. Although prices are falling,
multi-purpose industrial robots rely on expensive hardware and software, which means they
are not yet competitive with human labour in many regions outside of very standardised
processes. Existing humanoid robots for industrial use cost at least USD 100 000, although
some producers have ambitions to reduce costs to around USD 20 000 to USD 30 000. Even
humanoid robots, which can be integrated into spaces designed for humans, require
software investment in domain models, which are complex to produce, particularly for small
and medium-sized enterprises. “Cobots”, which work alongside humans, are emerging as
one alternative approach. These robots can be deployed with less training since humans can
help support their work in complex cases.
Battery technology may limit the durability of mobile industrial robots and the applications
in which they can be used. While recent software developments in robotics have been
remarkable, greater deployment will depend equally on hardware improvement and will
benefit from battery R&D and supply chain performance. Some multi-purpose robots

operate for only one to two hours on a single charge, driving down utilisation factors and
reducing their competitiveness. Beyond duration, many robots are intended to perform high-
power tasks, such as lifting heavy objects, for which existing battery technologies are not
well suited, and which pose additional challenges such as overheating. To achieve autonomy
equivalent to that of a human shift worker, battery energy densities would need to increase
by a factor of around two. At today’s rate of battery improvement, this would take around
10 years. Battery swapping is a feasible alternative that could enable higher overall
utilisation, but it is only practical in certain contexts, increases costs and may constrain
battery technology selection because cells need to be arranged so that the pack can be
removed easily from the robot’s chassis. For these reasons, new battery technologies are
likely to be required to enable the widespread uptake of industrial robotics. Leaders in
battery development may therefore have an advantage in industrial robot design and
deployment.

industrial optimisation closer to large‑scale deployment. Yet traditional AI applications that
optimise production processes still offer substantial untapped potential, especially in
energy‑intensive industries such as steel and aluminium production, where existing tools can
strengthen competitiveness by cutting energy costs by 3-10%. For advanced manufacturing
processes where digitalisation is already prioritised and energy costs represent a smaller
share of total production costs, emerging physical AI systems, such as increasingly adaptive
robots, could provide productivity gains.
Robot deployment has largely stagnated in recent years, with global installations hovering at
around 55 000 units in 2024, but the rise of physical AI and a step change in capabilities could
alter this trend, with investor interest already rising and the number of robotics and AI
patents surging. From an energy perspective, efficient robots can increase the
competitiveness of clean energy technologies, and advances in battery technologies will play
a key role in improving the efficiency of robots by extending their operating time.

11 If AI drives a boom in productivity and GDP, what
would it mean for energy demand?
11.1 AI’s impact on productivity: From micro-level gains to macro effects
Labour productivity growth has slowed markedly across advanced economies over the past
two decades.13 In many advanced economies, productivity growth has trended downward
since the early 2000s, even in the United States, where performance has been comparatively
stronger. Against this backdrop, recent rapid advances in AI have raised expectations that
the slowdown in productivity growth could begin to reverse.
Micro-level evidence provides a consistent signal: AI tools can substantially increase worker
efficiency across a wide range of tasks. Across controlled trials and field deployments, AI has
repeatedly delivered sizeable efficiency improvements (Table 11.1), typically reducing
completion times for writing, customer support, software development, legal drafting and
translation tasks by 15-50%.

Labour productivity in the United States grew at an annualised rate of 4.9% in the third
quarter of 2025, one of the strongest readings in two decades, while unit labour costs fell for
a second consecutive quarter (Figure 11.1). While this recent acceleration has coincided with
the diffusion of AI tools across firms, its underlying drivers remain uncertain. Productivity
growth has historically been stronger in more digitally exposed sectors. The growing uptake
of AI, with around 20% of US firms now using AI in their operations (U.S. Census Bureau,
2026), together with evidence of time savings from generative AI use, suggests that AI could
be starting to contribute to measured productivity growth.
Beyond near‑term productivity effects, estimates of AI’s potential impact on GDP vary
widely, reflecting differing assumptions about which tasks the technology will be used for,
the speed of adoption and the scale of complementary investment. Even so, they typically
project that AI will provide a boost to economic output (OECD, 2025). Some projections are
extremely ambitious. Korinek and Suh (2024) explore stylised scenarios in which AI raises

International Energy Agency | Key questions on energy and AI

GDP by 2% per year under “business-as usual” assumptions, with much higher growth rates
(18% annually) arising if artificial general intelligence emerges. More modest, but still
optimistic, assessments come from Acemoglu (2024), who estimates that AI could increase
GDP by 0.92% to 1.6% in total over the next ten years, corresponding to roughly
0.55 percentage points of additional productivity growth. Goldman Sachs (2023) estimates
that AI could raise global GDP by 7% over a ten-year adoption period, driven by an increase
in annual productivity growth of around 1.5 percentage points. Aghion and Bunel (2024)
place AI’s impact between these estimates, suggesting that AI could boost aggregate
productivity growth by around 0.8 to 1.3 percentage points per year. McKinsey Global
Institute projects an even larger contribution, suggesting that AI and other automation
technologies could lift global productivity growth by 0.5 to 3.4 percentage points per year
over the period through to 2040 (McKinsey, 2023). The emerging consensus is that AI’s
impact will depend critically on the breadth and speed of adoption and on the availability of
complementary assets such as data, compute capacity, organisational capabilities and
human capital.

may translate into higher demand for the outputs of another, and that this higher demand
may in turn be met through increased international trade. It starts from experimental
evidence on how AI affects task performance, maps this to sector-level productivity
improvements based on each country’s economic structure and exposure to AI-relevant
tasks and then evaluates how these effects propagate across sectors within national
economies and across borders via trade.
In the central scenario, which assumes a medium pace of economic adoption of AI tools and
improvements in AI capabilities consistent with current trends, AI is estimated to raise per
capita real income growth by around 0.1 to 0.95 percentage points per year across major
economies over the next decade. The largest gains occur in countries where knowledge-
intensive service sectors, such as information and communications technology, finance and
professional services, make up a significant share of the economy and where conditions for
AI adoption, including digital infrastructure, skills and innovation capacity, are strongest
(Figure 11.2).

11.2 What could be the impact of higher productivity from AI on energy
demand?
Macroeconomic trends are an important driver of energy demand. Since 2000, energy
demand has increased by an average of 1.9% annually, compared with average GDP growth
of 3.3% per year. As economic growth supports rising incomes, people tend to use existing

goods more, driving cars more often, spending more in the services sector and purchasing
additional products.
However, the impact of faster economic growth on energy demand varies significantly across
sectors and countries, reflecting differences in the responsiveness of energy service demand
to rising incomes (Figure 11.3). In advanced economies, per capita energy demand peaked in
the mid-2000s and has since fallen by 15%. Over the same period, GDP per capita increased
by one-quarter. In these economies, structural shifts in the economy towards services and
improved technologies have led to a saturation in energy demand. In contrast, in emerging
markets and developing economies, rising incomes translate more directly into higher
demand for energy-intensive goods and services, and energy demand has continued to
increase. Similarly, there are wide differences between countries in the deployment of
technologies and their efficiency. In analysing the potential impacts of an AI-driven GDP
boost on energy demand, capturing these dynamics at a granular regional and sectoral level
is essential.

Based on the OECD economic modelling described above, AI adoption could lift global GDP
by 1.3-3.8% above its baseline level in 2035 (OECD, 2026). For this report, we use IEA energy
demand models for each major economy to estimate the effects of this additional GDP
growth on energy demand. We estimate that global energy demand could rise by 0.9% to
2.6%, or by 6 EJ to 19 EJ, relative to current trends by 2035. This range of additional demand
is comparable to the current annual demand of the United Kingdom and Japan, respectively.

Impact of AI on energy

In advanced economies, total energy demand is projected to continue its declining trend in
a scenario aligned with today’s policy settings, even as GDP continues to grow. In our cases
with an additional GDP increase due to AI, energy demand in advanced economies receives
a modest boost. At the upper end of our AI growth cases, this boost is sufficient to offset the
decline in energy demand seen in our baseline scenarios, holding energy demand at its
current level (Figure 11.4).
Figure 11.4 ⊳ Impact of higher AI-related productivity on GDP and energy
demand by economic grouping by 2035

IEA. CC BY 4.0.
An AI-related GDP increase could lead to 0.9% - 2.6% higher energy demand by 2035,
offsetting declines in advanced economies and accelerating growth in EMDEs
Notes: EMDE = emerging markets and developing economies. Low and high refer to the upper and lower range
of the GDP impact.
Source: IEA analysis with GDP data from OECD (2026).
In emerging markets and developing economies, the additional GDP in our AI scenarios is
concentrated largely in China and India. This is due to the presence in both countries of
knowledge-intensive services (which benefit directly from the AI productivity boost) and
manufacturing (which benefits indirectly through higher global demand). Overall, energy
demand is projected to grow strongly in emerging markets and developing economies in a
scenario aligned with today’s policy settings, increasing by around 13%. At the high end of
our AI cases, this increase rises to 16%.
There are, however, several sources of uncertainty that could limit the scale of AI-related
impacts on energy demand. In macroeconomic projections, the magnitude of additional GDP
growth attributable to AI is difficult to isolate from the growth already embedded in baseline
projections. Productivity gains could also have negative implications for labour markets,
which could place downward pressure on macroeconomic outcomes. In the energy system,
higher incomes do not automatically translate into proportionally higher energy use.

International Energy Agency | Key questions on energy and AI

Households and firms may invest in more efficient technologies, replacing appliances, air
conditioners or vehicles earlier than assumed in current models, or they may switch to
electric mobility, all of which would temper the rise in energy demand. At the same time,
widespread deployment of existing AI applications could generate substantial energy savings
within the energy system itself. Optimisation of industrial production processes, advanced
building energy management systems and improved transport routing could all reduce
energy consumption (Box 11.1). These savings could be amplified further if AI enables
disruptive innovations that reshape processes and technologies across multiple sectors.
Box 11.1 ⊳ Can we estimate the net impact of AI on the global energy system?
In addition to quantifying the additional energy demand resulting from potentially higher
macroeconomic productivity gains, the IEA has already quantified other aspects of the
energy and AI nexus. These include energy demand from data centres, the energy savings
potential from widespread AI deployment and rebound effects from lower energy prices.
Nonetheless, aggregating these estimates to determine the overall impact of AI is
complex, as the underlying measurements vary significantly in their scope and level of
uncertainty.
The estimates with the highest degree of confidence and evidence are the projections on
the future demand of data centres. These rely on a bottom-up approach that considers
shipments of different types of IT equipment, complemented by detailed tracking of data
centre projects. The outlook reflects rising demand for a broad range of server classes
alongside anticipated improvements in server efficiency. Data centre electricity demand
is projected to rise from around 500 TWh today to between 700 TWh and 1 700 TWh in
2035, depending on the case. Uncertainties remain around the pace of AI adoption and
the rapid evolution of model and hardware efficiency. The robustness of the modelling
framework and the growing systemic importance of data centres mean that these
projections are fully integrated into the long-term scenarios of the World Energy Outlook.
The quantification of potential energy savings from the adoption of known AI
optimisations in end-use sectors is based on well-documented empirical case studies.
However, extrapolating from case studies to estimates of sector-wide potential is
uncertain. To reach the potential estimated savings of around 14 EJ, AI solutions would
need to reach high deployment rates over the next ten years. Important barriers to
reaching these rates include progress on regulation, digitalisation, trust and skills. There
is also further uncertainty about a potential rebound effect following these savings if AI-
driven savings lower the cost of energy services and therefore ultimately result in higher
demand.
Estimating the impact of AI-related productivity gains on energy demand across all
sectors is challenging and highly uncertain. First, as noted above, models of AI’s impact
on GDP produce a wide range of outcomes and depend on assumptions regarding AI
capabilities and uptake, as well as macroeconomic uncertainties, such as the impact on

labour markets and incomes. Second, higher economic activity does not translate directly
into higher energy demand, as the effects are influenced by technology choices,
consumer behaviour, innovation trends and policies. These factors result in a wide range
of potential outcomes for the boost to energy demand in 2035, ranging from 6 EJ to 19 EJ.
For these reasons, the effects of data centres on electricity demand are already
integrated into the modelling framework and scenarios of the IEA’s World Energy
Outlook. The cases analysing the potential impact of an AI-driven economic boost on
energy demand are exploratory in nature and are included in this report to provide
stakeholders with a framework for considering the key determinants, uncertainties and
possible orders of magnitude. Neither these estimates, nor the IEA’s estimates of the
energy-saving potential of AI applications, are included in the scenarios of the World
Energy Outlook.
Figure 11.5 ⊳ Impact of different AI-related effects on global energy
demand, 2035

IEA. CC BY 4.0.
The uptake of AI can increase and decrease global energy demand in
different ways, but these estimates vary greatly in their level of uncertainty
Notes: Low = low GDP additionality, high = high GDP additionality. The quantification of potential energy
savings refers to the widespread scaling of existing AI applications across different end-use sectors as
assessed in previous IEA analysis (IEA, 2025a).
11.3 Key takeaways
AI has the potential to lift productivity and accelerate economic growth, but the scale and
timing of any macroeconomic boost depend on how quickly AI is adopted, how effectively
firms reorganise to use these tools, and whether the required complementary investments
in skills, data and digital infrastructure materialise. The implications for energy demand are
similarly complex. Higher activity does not necessarily translate into proportionally higher

energy use, as technology choices, efficiency improvements, innovation and policy
frameworks all shape the outcome. The analysis presented here indicates that, if AI adoption
were to lift global GDP levels by around 1.3-3.8% above the baseline in 2035, as modelled by
the OECD, global energy demand could increase by roughly 0.9-2.6% at that horizon
compared with the baseline outlook.
Other AI‑related trends monitored by the IEA will also affect outcomes. These include rising
electricity needs from the expansion of data centres and potential efficiency improvements
across end‑use sectors as energy services become increasingly automated and responsive.
As highlighted in this analysis, these elements cannot simply be combined to estimate a
single net impact of AI on the energy system. The IEA will continue to track these changes
and enhance the evidence base, helping to improve modelling methods and ensure that long-
term scenarios incorporate AI-related shifts with appropriate recognition of the key
uncertainties.

Methodology for data centre energy demand
The modelling of data centre electricity demand relies on a bottom-up approach developed
by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory over the past two decades. In this modelling
approach, IT equipment shipments are the key driver of data centre electricity demand. We
analyse three types of IT equipment: servers, storage systems, and network equipment. The
last category refers to network equipment hosted within data centre facilities to connect
servers and storage devices to the data network. It should not be confused with the data
transmission network, which connects data centres and end-users (for example, 5G network
towers). The latter falls outside the scope of the modelling of data centre electricity
consumption in this study.
The central input to the model is the annual shipment of servers. These come from:

IDC’s (International Data Corporation), which provides shipment projections for the
period 2019-2028 (IDC, 2024)

These are triangulated with additional data inputs from Omdia (OMDIA, 2025), (OMDIA,
2026), SemiAnalysis (SemiAnalysis, 2025c), and Borderstep Institute (Hintemann,
Hinterholtzer, and Konrat, 2024), and additional literature (Koomey, 2007), (Koomey,
2011), (Shehabi, et al., 2024), (Shehabi, et al., 2018), (Shehabi, et al., 2016), (Gartner,
2014a, 2014b, 2014c, 2015a, 2015b, 2015c, 2015d, 2016a, 2016b, 2017a, 2017b, 2017c,
2018a, 2018b, 2020), (Masanet, et al., 2020), (Malmodin, et al., 2024).
The stock of storage drives is derived from hard-disk drive shipment data from Forbes
(Forbes, 2021) and the split between HDDs and solid-state drives from (SSDs) (Shehabi, et
al., 2024). The stock of network equipment is estimated based on server port density.
We distinguish three types of data centres, which serve as archetypes in this model:
enterprise data centres, colocation and service provider data centres, and hyperscale data
centres.
The technical characteristics of the server stock, such as lifetime and power consumption, as
well as operational characteristics like idle power ratio and utilisation rates, are based on
estimates from the United States (Shehabi, et al., 2024). Similarly, for storage drives, the split
between storage technologies and average utilisation rates is also based on US estimates.
The characteristics of storage drives are assumed to be constant across all data centre types.
The network port distribution is also assumed to be constant, with one exception: specific
InfinityBand-like network equipment, whose stock depends solely on accelerated servers.
Based on these datasets and input assumptions, we estimate the installed capacity for each
type of IT equipment. It is important to note that these values differ from the maximum
designed capacity, as they consider only the installed units of each IT equipment type and do
not reflect total rack capacity.

International Energy Agency | Key questions on energy and AI

The regional allocation of global installed IT capacities relies on several factors. The primary
driver is the regional breakdown provided by our third-party data provider (IDC), which is
based on market dynamics in each region. To achieve finer regional granularity, we also
consider the level of digitalisation of economies based on the digital adoption index (World
Bank, 2016) and the development of the local data centre market, using publicly available
data on data centre market revenues (Statista, 2024), (Turner&Townsend, 2024), and project
databases (OMDIA, 2025), (BNEF, 2025).
Network equipment is assumed to have a 100% utilisation rate. Storage systems utilisation
rates are considered constant. Idle power assumptions are based on trends observed in the
SERT database for conventional servers and estimates from the literature for accelerated
servers (SPEC, 2024), (Shehabi, et al., 2024).
Aggregation of utilisation rates is conducted by data centre type. The equation for the
electricity consumption of servers is as follows:
𝐸𝐸= (𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚−𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖) ∗ 𝑢𝑢+ 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
Where:

𝑃𝑃𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 is the maximum power draw of an operating server (distinct from the maximum
rated power, especially for accelerated servers).

𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the power drawn by a server when not processing useful tasks.

𝑢𝑢 is the server utilisation rate.
For each region and data centre type, IT electricity demand is multiplied by the
corresponding Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) to obtain the total electricity demand of the
infrastructure and hosted IT equipment.
PUE primarily accounts for cooling equipment, power supply equipment, and lighting. Power
supply equipment and lighting are collectively referred to as “auxiliary equipment”. Data
centre type influences PUE due to variations in infrastructure efficiency, climate also affects
PUE by directly impacting cooling requirements. PUE estimates are based on regional climate
and data centre type (enterprise, colocation and service provider, and hyperscale) (Lei and
Masanet, 2022). We assume that regional differences within the same data centre category
arise from variations in cooling needs. The relative evolution of PUE over time is informed by
improvements reported in company-level data (Google, 2025c).
The simplified equation for data centre electricity demand in each region is as follows:
𝐸𝐸𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐=
෍
(𝐸𝐸𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,𝑖𝑖+ 𝐸𝐸𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠,𝑖𝑖+ 𝐸𝐸𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛,𝑖𝑖 ) ∗𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖

operating environment, using data and constraints particular to that domain. Domain-
specific models are typically much smaller and less computationally intensive than general-
purpose models.

Key Questions on Energy and AI
World Energy Outlook Special Report
The development and uptake of artificial intelligence (AI)
has accelerated in recent years – elevating the question of
what widespread deployment of the technology will mean
for the energy sector. There is no AI without energy –
specifically electricity for data centres. At the same time,
AI could transform how the energy industry operates if
it is adopted at scale. However, until now, policy makers
and other stakeholders have often lacked the tools
to analyse both sides of this issue due to a lack of
comprehensive data.

This report from the International Energy Agency (IEA)
aims to fill this gap based on new global and regional
modelling and datasets, as well as extensive consultation
with governments and regulators, the tech sector, the
energy industry and international experts. It includes
projections for how much electricity AI could consume
over the next decade, as well as which energy sources
are set to help meet it. It also analyses what the uptake of
AI could mean for energy security, emissions, innovation
and affordability.
